I know that there's tremendous constant noise about issues as fundamental as Israel's right to exist even and you start by talking about in in your book you embark on explaining that at least in some part by talking about herzl and his Terror that anti-Semitism that the rise of anti-Semitism in Europe was going to cause a catastrophe which was obviously a Justified Terror would you be kind enough to walk me and my viewers and listeners through your rationale for the moral justification for Israel or the political justification as well and I'm going to do what I can to my limited ability let's say to push back I've heard the arguments of ten young people who are more prone to give Credence and sympathy to say to the Palestinian Viewpoint and I'd like to rectify my ignorance and maybe help my viewers and listeners do the same thing so it would it be useful to start with herzl well I'd actually I'd start her herzl was what I call our modern Moses but I'd actually start with the original Moses the Jewish people have lived in the land of Israel what is now the state of Israel have lived here and have been attached to this place for about 3 500 years three and a half Millennia now for the first two Millennia roughly of that time uh we were living in what is described in a text commonly known as the Bible so the Bible describes how the Jewish people lived on this land were attached to this land fought off conquerors sometimes were conquered but stayed on their land and that continued for a very long time until roughly the sixth seventh century actually after the birth of Christ okay for for roughly for two thousand years uh we were conquered by the Romans we were conquered by the byzantines they did a lot of bad things to us but they didn't really Exile us contrary to what people think okay the ones the the loss of our land actually occurred when the Arab Conquest took place in the 7th Century the Arabs burst out from Arabia and they did something that no other conqueror not the Romans not the byzantines not the Greeks before them not Alexander the Great nobody did before they actually started taking over the land of the Jewish Farmer they brought in military colonies that took over the land and gradually over the next two centuries the Jews became a minority in our land so it is under the Arab Conquest that the Jews lost their Homeland the Arabs were the Colonials the Jews were the natives dispossessed well that happens in history the Jews were dispossessed we were flung to the Far Corners of the earth uh suffered unimagined terrible suffering because we had no Homeland but we didn't disappear and we never gave up the dream of coming back to our ancestral Homeland so generation after generation Jews could be in Warsaw they could be in Yemen they could be in uh they could be in China and they said next year in Jerusalem will come back next year in Jerusalem well that was made possible because the Arabs who had conquered the land best basically left it Barren they never made it their own it was a Barren land it really had practically it was an empty land and in the 19th century the idea of coming back next year in Jerusalem became a reality by the way in part because of Christian Zionist support for the idea of the great return the Jews came back in the 19th century to the land of Israel the result of this return was that we started building Farms factories places of employment Arabs for nearby countries started immigrating and they now became they call themselves Palestinians they reconstructed history and said we've been here for centuries no they haven't they weren't there at all and they didn't have a national Consciousness we came back made it our land and we said okay we now will live together we decided to establish a state in 1948 that's 75 years ago and we we said everybody can live here the Arab said there can't be a Jewish State you have no right to be here it's our land it's not your land it's been our land for 3 500 years if you took over your uh somebody's apartment knock them out dispossessed them and they never gave up the claim and they said it's our claim and you left this Barren dump okay and this the the the families the progeny of the people you you kicked out came back rebuilt the house you cannot come back and tell them you don't belong here we're going to kick you out especially since your late companies who come to live in you know in part of the house which is what the so-called Palestinians are okay we say to them you can live here we can live here but it's our land it's our state and the reason this conflict continues is because the Palestinians who are represent the the colonial Powers the Arab Conquest uh of the Middle East and Beyond they're saying you have no right for a Jewish State well we do if any people has any right to a state if any people never gave up their dreams of returning to their ancestral home if any people rebuilt their home from nothing from Barren wasted land it's the Jewish people to tell them you have suffered more than anyone else you have never lost your dream of coming back and rebuilding your National Life in your ancestral Homeland you have no right to be there but the Arabs who are trying to destroy you they have that right that is a complete perversion of history and also a complete perversion of Justice the Jews belong to this land this land belongs to the Jews the Palestinians are free to live here next to us among us but they're not free to demand the dissolution of the Jewish state that is not Justice that is Injustice that's the shortest lecture I can give you about Jewish history so you so why do you think the claim that the Palestinians were somehow there in Israel first and have been displaced in a colonial occupation let's say by the Jews why do you think that idea has gained such cachet not least in the west because of ignorance I mean what do you mean they were here first well you know you're familiar with the story of Jesus right Jesus was a Jewish rabbi living in 2000 years ago he was a rabbi from the Galilee okay he came to Jerusalem he turned the money tables of the uh the the the tables of the money changers on the Temple Mount where did that happen did it happen in Tibet it happened here Jerusalem was our capital King David made it our Capital three thousand years ago so the Jews are here to try to uh to say that they weren't here and that the Palestinians were here thousands of years ago is ridiculous anybody you know anybody who can you can actually Google this and and find out how absurd this thing is so as far as the Reinventing ancient history that is that is unpardonable because anybody can find out and understand that the Jews were here for thousands of years the Palestinians weren't here as far as modern times are concerned what did Palestinians have said is oh and I I write this in my book and I show it because it's so comical what what they say is we were here uh Palestine was a verdant land in the 19th century teaming with the you know with the Palestinians until the Jews came in and took it over and threw it out okay well that's what Arafat effectively said in his uh Infamous speech in the United Nations blaming uh Zionism equating Zionism with racism well there's only one problem with that he said that the Jewish invasion of this burden-palestinian Homeland uh happened in 1881 okay the problem with that is that uh 12 years before a famous visitor among hundreds of visitors named Mark Twain visited the holy land and he describes a totally different picture he describes Palestine I'm quoting him is a vast Wasteland he said only imagination can Grace this Barren land with the pomp of circumstance in life it's just he said we travel for a whole day we didn't see in the Galilee we didn't see a human being one single human being he said Jerusalem sits in sackcloth and Ashes and as he was saying that it's the Jewish return that began the Jewish return that began building the land well perhaps one could argue it's obvious that Mark Twain was not in the service of the Jewish State because it didn't exist he wasn't in the service of the Jewish Lobby because it was an Eddie Jewish Lobby he was just reporting what was there could there possibly have been a tremendous influx of Palestinians between 1869 and 1881 the year that that Arafat says the Jewish Invasion began and destroyed the Palestinian Paradise well alas no because in the year 1881 another famous visitor visits Israel and he writes visits this land and he writes also his Memoirs okay his name was Arthur penrin Stanley he was a very famous very famous courtier of uh Queen Victoria's Court okay and he came here on a special visit and he says I looked South and I looked North he says I'm in Judea and I see nothing he says a Barren expanse and they both Express both Twain and Arthur penrith Stanley say the same thing when when or when will the Jews come back and bring this land to life and the answer is right then we came back brought it back to life there were Arabs living here but it was as I said a Barren Wasteland but Arabs began to immigrate naturally because we created a rise in the standard of living that attracted Arabs from neighboring states those Arabs are now those the descendants of those Arabs who migrated as a result of the Jewish return many of them now are considered Palestinians so what I'm saying and I'm saying this to you uh Jordan and to your audience there has been a complete fabrication of History it's the biggest lie of the big lies that have permeated the 20 20th century in the 21st century is to say that the ABS were here before that is the Palestinians who are here before the Jews when we were here for thousands of years that we are the Colonials when in fact it was the Arabs who were the Colonials who dispossessed the original Natives and that is the Jews then we came back to this land that was laid Barren by the Arab Conquest brought it back to life and allowed Arab immigration what we call now Palestinian immigration to come back in and now they say to us in unimaginable you know they say you don't belong here they recreate ancient history they recreate modern history and this is a lot of how come it's ridiculous.
