So  let's bring in  Dr.  Melanie Garson. associate  professor.  in  Conflict   resolutions and  International.  Security   in the  department  of   political science at   University  College,  London   a friend  of  the show  here.  Thank you so much for taking   the time  to  be  here  with   us  today.  We  appreciate   it  as always.  Thank you for  having  me  back  again.   Good  morning,  Josh. Good   morning.  Well  first off  here, I just  want to get  kind of your  take  as  we   are hearing.  of  course   from  Hamas that  they do  plan  to  accept  this  deal.  Does  it  appear  that  a  deal  is  really? closer  to?  happening?  Could we  see it   accepted  soon  and maybe the  hostages? released? well  we   hope  for the release of  the  hostages  soon enough and  later We're talking now  tomorrow. We're coming  up   to 12.  of those  hostages.  um  underground with  very   little  air and and no   confirmation  of  their  condition.  Um, it's  kind of  the estimated that  the  probability is the  deal   right now is  about 5050. Uh,  from  what  we  understand   about the document  itself   It was  fairly  short deal   about 2 to 3 pages. only   which uh pros and cons of  that  we  can discuss the  sort  of  thinking  about  um what the conditions  are  as  that  if  you find  the  identified  committee for as   long  as  it  seats, 5  as   possible. with  um, I did  say there's a different  model.  so   of being touted as  to  what   that  looks like  and what   seems to  be  coming  into   the concern of  that  um  to   be  aware of  is  that  um,  Ramadan that  the holy  month  for um, months and  people   to  kicks off.  uh  in  March  through to  April,  so  they   talk of trying  to  have  any  ceasefire that's  going  through going through to  the  end of  that  period  in   particular. And yeah  that   question  has been  kind of  on  the table for a while  because we've seen  several  different.  possible  deals  that have come  through and  obviously at this point none   of  them. have  come  to   fruition. now.  an   advisor to  Iran's  Islamic  revolutionary guard Corps  died  after another apparent   Israeli strike  near   Damascus  if  a ceasefire  deal  is  reached with   Hamas.  Does  that  have  any  impact  on  these strikes  that  are taking  place?  in   Syria?  that   a really interesting question, and it's  a question. in   relation  to  the extent.  that  actually  the strike   see ilgisi  involvement.  Um   in  relation  to  the  northern  border  and  a little  bit of  action   from  the Syrian  on  the  Syrian  border  itself. as   the extent  of  the long  arm  of  Iran  in  Syria and in   Lebanon,  that's  making  the  situation more  unstable,  I think what  uh  has been   noted though  that  Iran  is   very  aware of  these attacks  and there has been  a move   to  pull  out.  many  of  its  senior  officials.  from   Syria in  particular  because  they're aware of  this   threat  and they  don't want   to  uh, put some of them   they've senior  officials in   the line of fire. So  it's  a  potential uh  area  I'm not  entirely  sure  that  the  ceasefire with  Hamas.  will   necessarily impact. that   dynamic if  uh, Iran,  involvement across  that   sort  of  credit  remains.   Um  and so  I think we've got  2 different things. sort  of   that  are currently linked   but we  might see diverge.   um  going forward.  and uh   more  of  a possible  threat   here, I guess Iran's   president saying  that  his  country will  not start a  war,  but that  quote if   anyone  wants to  bully us   they  will  receive a strong   response. Who exactly is   that  aimed at  and what   do you  make  of  those  comments  Is  it  really   anything  new?  because I  feel  as  though  you and I  have  talked  about threats  from  Iran. quite a bit  in the  times that  we've  chatted here. Uh, I don't  think it's  new I think what   is  happening?  is  that   Iran  operates  through its  proxies whether that's  in   the kinetic field whether  that's  on  the Cyber domain.  They're very  good   at having.  a long  arm and  getting other people  to  do   their dirty work  and they   will  fight to  the end.  of   that  last  person  whoever  it is.  doing their work   now.  I think we've seen  2  things  that  are interesting  in  this  week  is  that  the  escalation  possibly,  you know  the risk  when   you're  working with  proxies  is  that  they  go  off on  a  policy  of  their own and the  question  of  do  you lose  a  little  bit of  that? command  of  control particularly   foxes Fields themselves being  successful  either  they   want  to  uh  engage  on   their own they  want  to   break away  a little  bit  from  the  person that's controlling  them. or  they  want  to   kind of prove themselves. of   even  more  useful. in   return  to  whatever   the kwid program. I think so.  They are where  they've  created a dangerous  situation.  and I think  they're pulling back. So  I  think it is a signaling to   the US. and Israel  in   particular. that  perhaps  some of these actions.  are  spiraling a little bit. out  of  control and I don't like   to  be  out of  control.  so   it's  sort  of  putting some   strong  messaging but I think  what  we're seeing  is.  little  chinks  of  weakness   the fact  that  they're  pulling back. their senior   leadership  from  Syria is   you know, there's a seems to   be  a need within around   right now to  consolidate.   what  they  feel  are things.  that  perhaps are  throwing a little bit around   the edges.  talking about the  situation going on  in   Lebanon as  well  Does  it   appear  that  Israel  is   headed  for war with   Hezbollah?  It's  a war that   nobody. wants.  Um  in   particular. and but we  have   seen  the talk  within   Israel  of  um. a new  mobilization. and  mobilization. to  uh  the  northern  border. I did hear   the number  to  a sort  of   20,000  or  so. being spoken   about yesterday.  it is very   very  fragile.  Obviously,   there's been  a big  evacuations from  the  northern  borders people  are  anxious to  return  to  their  homes.  They  can't return   to  their homes.  Um, it's   also  a small place in  these  levels  of  internal   displacement  both  from   the south and the north  causing a lot of  pressure   in  the center, but there's a  need  to  secure  that   border  the Lebanese  people   particularly  don't want  it   in an interesting.  again  with  the convergence in  the  Cyber domain  a couple  of   weeks ago.  there was a a  very sort of  Lebanese   activist  group that   actually  took  over. uh  the  screens in  the airports  and  say to  a message of  his Val  to  say that  this  is   Lebanon is  not about your   War.  We  don't want  this   Wars  of  vast  majority  of   people  don't want  it, but  they  sit again a war with   another terrorist group of   which uh, there is  a  long arm. Um, of  Iran   involved  in  And 1 thing I  want to ask you about  President Biden issued  an   executive order yesterday.   that  kind of targets order  yesterday that kind of   targets Israeli settlers  in   the West  Bank accused  of   attacking Palestinians  and  posing  some  Financial  sanctions and Visa  bans   there.  Does  that  have  any  effect  on  the US  Israel   relationship   as the war is ongoing there?   Um, it's  a brilliant  interesting move  and um  and  it  is  a White House  spokesperson. John  Kirby did  say that. Um, Israel. knew   about it. It's  not so  how  much  uh, they've known about  it. Um, it's not  designed   that  been  subsequent   conversations of  will   people  like  Minister   have been much also be   targeted  in  that  and  they said that it's not  no intent to  talk  it   government  officials.  Um, I  think that  this  is  more   I mean, this  is  part  of   Biden,  dealing with  um, but  president by dealing with his  uh  internal  domestic   politics. that  particularly   with  looking towards  Michigan  and there's been   um  a sense that  the  American  population  is  um,  you know, a key uh  area  of   Voters  particularly  in   Mumbai in mind  that  um, he   only  1 there by  154,000  votes and the  states out of America.   population  over  278,000  votes,  I think.  part  of   it is a key to  appease it  I  think there will be a sense  that. uh, there will be some   concern actually  within  the  us about  um  this   legislation.  more  but then   actually  necessarily us. Um,  Israel  relations directly,  I think it's  a it's  a minor  drop  in  that  relationship.  All right,  Dr. Melanie  Garson. Thank you so  much   for taking  the time  to  be   here  and help  break down   the latest  headlines  anything  else  you want to  add Before  I Let You Go. Uh,  not today,  I mean  as  we   say we're keeping the eye on   what  this  hostage deal.  will  look  like  I think um,  there'll be more  doubling   down  of  the population. So   I think bearing in mind that   the area  of  concern that   increasingly  the families   of the  hostages  are taking   action  into their own   hands.  They're stopping   humanitarian  convoys,  So   this  deal  the pressure  for  both  Israel  to  try and  meet  its obligation  to   provide.  humanitarian  Aid  and internal  dissent that's   preventing. that  obligation   will  be  a cause for  concern.  Um, say 120 days   Underground.  is  um, without  food  necessarily medicines  and everything confirmed  is   a source of concern.  and  it's as odious  as  needed   negotiation to  are the  question  of  some  of  the  um, people  who are being  touted  in  return. for the  hostages  are assigned of um,  perhaps I must  try to  set  up  a political leadership.  once  uh  drilling  down   some  of the  military   leadership  and what  that   picture will  look  like  but  um  seeing  what  that  deal   would look  like. and as  far  as  many  people  concerned  if  that  deal  doesn't start  with  the release of  the  bbas  family. I'm not sure   how many  of  the conditions   going forward.  will  be   maintained  if  it's  a phase  release of hostages.   All right,  Dr. Melanie  Garson  as  always. Thank you  so  much  for taking  the  time  to  be  here  and  to help break down  the  latest  headlines a lot  developing  there and I'm  sure  between now and  tomorrow  there will be a lot  of  developments  again.   Thank you for being here   with  us.

We   appreciate  having  you here   We  want to get straight  to   the news. of  the day though   per the time  of Israel.   Cutters foreign Ministry   announced that  Hamas has  given its initial positive   confirmation. to  a proposed   deal  that  would see  hostages  freed and fighting   in  Gaza  stop  for a period   of  time. the times says   that  Israel  has agreed  to   The proposal  confirming   reports.  That's  Jerusalem.   Okayed  the deal  at   negotiations  in  Paris this   weekend.  at  this  point.   What  do we know  about?  how  this  potential deal  could  work? alone?  because Qatar  did put this  out initially.   then. Hamas actually  stated   That's  not true   specifically. Lebanon state.   That's  not true  Then  the  group itself  also. said   that's  not true. And then   Qatar actually  changed its  update  on  its website  saying  changing  changing   the wording.  saying  Hamas  positively  reacted to   receiving the proposal  and  is  debating  it. So  they've  scaled  back  a little  bit  saying  that  Hamas is   positive  about this. because  what  I think guitar  is   trying to do  is  actually   pressure  Hamas into   accepting so  they're  trying to say things  are  already moving  forward  celebrations  broke out in   Gaza  as  they  heard about  this. I think the Qatar is   actually  using this  to  try  to  pressure  Hamas into   this  but the sides are not  not there yet.  The Hamas is   debating  the deal  right  now.  What  is  happening is   there's 2 different  leadership's  to  Hamas.   There's this  was the  official  leader  of  the  group and he  resides  actually  in  Qatar and he's   What's called the external   leadership  and then  there's  no  who is  the leader  of   Hamas in the Gaza Strip,  but  since the war broke out,   he's  really  the leader   He's  the 1 who decided on   October 7th.  I didn't  even   know  it  was coming. And and  so  theoretically is the  1ag  to  this  deal  but the fact   is  he  actually  has no   presence  on the  ground  to   say stop  the fighting   release hostages  or  not.   So  the 2 signs are talking  to  1 another and trying  to   see and they  agree.  on   what  they're going to   demand  and then  they'll go   back  to  Qatar.   So we're likely going to  To   see their answer  only   in the  coming  days. What   do we know  about the deal   so  far is  that  it's  going  to  include several phases.  the first phase is   reportedly  according to   different leagues going to   be  between 35  days. to   possibly  45  days. and  it's going to be  a truce in   which time. 35  to  40   hostages  will be released   that  includes  women.   children  and elderly and  people  who are sick. Israel   will  in  turn  release a  certain amount  of   Palestinian prisoners,  but  reportedly, not the heavy  prisoners rather  again like   3 to  5 prisoners for each   of  these hospitals.  the  main  sticking point  is  the  second  phase of the  deal   in which  Israel  once   already soldiers  released   either  female  soldiers  or   possibly  male  soldiers   even  and Hamas as   reportedly  in  return  for  releasing them. demanding  several things  that  is   going to  be  almost   impossible  for Israel  to   agree to  that  includes.  releasing.  100 to  250  Palestinian prisoners per  each  to  I ultimately   several thousand. Palestinian  prisoners Israel. agreed  to   completely  withdraw  from   the Gaza  Strip and a  complete  end to  the war  Those things  are things   that  Israel  said  are not  going to  happen. What   seemingly is  the strategy   is  all the sides want  a  truce to  start?  in order   to  hopefully build upon   that. and then  maybe  convince  Israel. You know   what  you you can't restart  the war after 6 weeks,  so   therefore maybe you  will agree  to  the ceasefire  That  is  at least  what   reportedly  the United   States. wants to  happen.  They  want  to  just  just   do  the first phase then   we'll see.  it  remains to   be  seen  if  Hamas is  going  to  agree to  that  Hamas has  said  they're not going to   agree to  anything. unless   they  already have   guarantees. that  the end of   it  is  an  end to  the war  Israel  said  absolutely  not  going going to  agree to   that. So  it  remains to  be   seen. So, you know  the next   thing we  want to get to  and  I think we  do  have  another  tweet to  pull  up  on  this   1 as well Reuters reporting  that  Israel  prepared  to   advance its war on  Gaza   farther south to  areas like   Rafa  close to  the Egyptian   border  after claiming  to   have  dismantled  Hamas and  Han Eunice. I want to get to   Rafa  in  a second, but but  first the news  that  Hamas  has been  dismantled  in Han   Eunice  It  sounds  like  a  big deal  given it was   somewhat  of  a hub for Hamas  What  does  this  tell  us   about the progress  that   Israel is making  in  Gaza?  So  again,  I'll  say that   that's  a bit of  an   overstatement that  statement  was made  by  Minister of  Defense you have  Galan  today.  He  visited Hanes and  he  is   really minister of defense   and he  stated. to  the  soldiers. you have   dismantled  Hamas and haness.  That  that  is  not true   According to  what's  on  the  ground  on  the ground.  There's daily.  very  very   intensive battles  specifically  in  Western  Hanes.  and reportedly  the  idea  has not even  engaged  engaged Hamas is  Southern   Hanes. Brigade   hanun was in fact the 1 of   the strongest hubs  of  Hamas  and 4 different brigades   there.  the idea  of   reportedly  has already  managed Ani the Eastern  Brigade The Northern  Brigade  and possibly  is  now  engaging  the Western Brigade  However it  still remains to   be  seen  what  happens with   the southern  Brigade.  in   addition  to  that. There's  also  still the underground  Network the idea  of  has  been  engaged with  it. It   has not dismantled  it  yet.   I think what  the minister   of  defense was more  trying   to  indicate  with  this  is   look  Hanes is  a done  deal.  if  it  takes if  it  happens  now or  if  it  happens in  a  week  from  now.  and Eunice   as  far as  we're concerned  we  know  the  idea of going to quote unquote win.  there. It's dismantled   3 out of  the 4 brigades  and  it'll manage to dismantle the  fourth  without a lot of   losses  and therefore he was   saying  so  therefore the  sights  can already be  set  on  the next  goal  the next   city, which is  Rafa  so  I  would say it's  not it   hasn't  finished the world.  work  in  honest  in  terms  of  fighting  Hamas that's   going on  constantly  the  idea  of  assessments are  that  actually  a lot of  the  hostages  are still held  in   underground tunnels  underneath  so  it's  a far  cry to  say the IDF is  done   in  Hesse,  but I think what   they're trying  to  say is   that  the idea  has managed  to  achieve.  as  much   control on.  how is necessary to say look   it  may take  another week,  right but effectively this   is  going to be done  whether  it's  another week  another  2 weeks.  It's  not where it   was.  2 3 weeks ago where  oh my God.  they're entering   hanun is  what's  going to   happen. It's  pretty  clear  that  we  know  what's   going to  happen. They're  going to  win their It  may  just  take  another week  or   2.  I think that's  more  how  I would read  that   statement.  So, uh  the next   thing we  want to get to  and  you're looking  at  a picture  from  the times of  Gaza   right now.  I do  want  to   talk  about Rafa. a lot of   people  have  fled  South to   this  region  as  the war has  progressed  My   understanding.  Is  that   a lot of  humanitarian  Aid  has also  come  through the  rafah crossing  as well over   time. What  challenges  are  Palestinians  and the Israel   the Israeli military  both   facing  as  this  war appears  to  focus more  on  this   region. It  is  going to  be   a culmination.  of  some  of   the most  disastrous  things   that  we've seen  in the  war  if  the fighting  does   in fact go  there.  in   rafah we  have  right now.   upwards of  1 and a half   million people  in  a city   that  used  to  house 300,000  people. the vast  majority   of  the Palestinian  population  in the  Gaza   Strip has fled  to  Rafa  and  it's  called  the mossy area   which is  on the  coastal  line. They are  all housed   in  makeshift refugee camps.   The area  is  completely   overcrowded we are seeing in   their humanitarian  disasters  in terms  of  their reports  of  maternity hospitals are  300%  capacity  women giving   birth without anesthesia. We   also  had reports today of  a  black market  industry  that   is  starting  to  develop in   the refugee camps with   regards to  for example tents  that  are being sold  at  the  price of  what  used  to  be   a small apartment in the   Gaza  Strip also  a lack  of   the of  access  to  basic  Goods spreading of  hepatitis  A the situation in  the  refugee camps in  and around   Rafa  is  absolutely   atrocious.  with  that  the  idea  that  the idea  of   just  going to  invade  it   in  the same  way as  it   invaded the Northern  parts  of  the Gaza  Strip or  Hanes  is  not realistic.  rating   the areas.  There's no  room.  I'm now talking to  literally  no  room  for a tank  to  go   through the streets there  because there's tents in the   middle  of  the street. So   some  reports suggested that   the reports suggested that   to  do  now a reverse  evacuation. the people  who  have  become  internally   displaced and moved to  Rafa   now pull them back. to   Hanes or  to  other areas  of the central parts  of  the  Gaza  Strip in  order to   allow the idea  to go in.  that  may be  possible  It   seems unrealistic.  at the   same  time  if  you'd asked  me, you know  4 months  ago.   Can the IDF evacuate  1  million people  from  the  Northern  parts of  the Gaza   Strip,  I would have  set  this  completely  unrealistic  and it  happened  so  maybe  that  will  happen  as  part   of  the fighting. However,   even  if  that  does  happen,  that's  a major Challenge and  if  that  doesn't happen, the  idea  of  is  simply  not  going to  be  able  to   invade  in  the same  way.   It's  not going to  be  able   to  carry out the same   bombings. that They carried  out the bombings  paved the  way for IDF soldiers. to   come  in  and and fight with   a lot more  safety. It's  not  going to  be  able  to  carry  out these bombings  when   there are so many.   different.  refugees  spread   throughout  the area. in   addition  to  that. There's  1 more  major problem.  and  that  is  Egypt.  the  rafah city  is  actually   divided.  between the Gaza   Strip and Egypt.  That's   where the rafah crossing  is.  Israel's  peace treaty  with   Egypt was states  that   neither side  can have  more   than  x amount  of  troops   on  the border  as  a as   part of the peace treaty  and  Egypt has said  it  is  going  to  hold  Israel  to  that.  They've said  that  for  several reasons mostly   because they're fearful of  a  major ground  invasion  of   Israel  that  will  result   in  Palestinians  fleeing  across  the border. So  they   are trying  to  stop  Israel   from  coming  into  that. but  there is  that  would  compromise  Israel's   relationship  with  Egypt and  that  is  something Israel   cannot  afford to do  so.  that's  a difficult manic  crisis. in  addition  to  the  humanitarian  crisis. in   addition  to  the hardship   that  Israel  would have  an   invading. again I've  come   to  expect  the unexpected   in  this  War I would not  have  thought that  that   this  amount  of  civilians  would be  able  to  evacuate   from  the Northern  parts of   the Gaza  Strip.  So  maybe  it  will be possible. to   reevaluate  civilians,  but  right now it seems that at   least a lot more  planning   is going to have  to  happen   and certainly if  we  do  see  this  truth in  this  hostage  deal. It's  very  unlikely   to  happen  before  that.  right because we're because  that's  that's  something  that's  going to  take   weeks.  to  to  actually   implement.  and the hostage  deal is theoretically being  rude  now for the coming   weeks.  So  I can't see  Israel  starting  a major  operation.  if  it  wants the  hostage deal to succeed.  in   rafah before  either  the  negotiations  come  to   fruition  or  fail  I think  1 or the  other Yeah, we're  looking Uh, let's pull  up   this  clip  because we  have   uh  some  video posted  by   the Israeli Air Force showing  a fighter jet attacking  military  structures. in   southern  Lebanon.  where low  intensity fighting. continues  between Hezbollah and Israel.  the AP  today put out a  report  saying  the prospect   of  a full-scale  war between  Israel  and Hezbollah  terrifies people  on  both   sides of  the Border, but  some  see it  as  inevitable   Do  do  you get that  same   feeling doctor  that  it'll  be  tough to  avoid?  further  escalations between  the 2 parties?  at  this   point the problem is  not the  fighting  between the parties  the problem is  how do  the  parties come  back? to   saying  we  can live  with  a  status  quo.  because what   happened  on  October 7th.   shook Israeli Society so   much. the idea  that  Terror   organizations can just  break  through the IDF ranks,   you know  storm Israeli towns  and kidnap  civilians and  kidnap  soldiers. Hizballah  is  stronger  than  Hamas.   and by any measure  and so   if  Hamas could do  that. was  present on  the border   as extremely scary  to   Israelis  and thus  reports  between 80,000  and 200  thousand  but more  like  a  closer  to  80,000. civilians  Israeli civilians have   evacuated from  the Northern   parts of  Israel. for them   to  return  to  the North  Israelis said said we will   no longer allow  his Bala to be on the border.  So  theoretically if  the war  in  Gaza  ends, both sides   could stop  their fire  and  that's it.  but that's   actually  not good  enough   at this point and that's  why  escalations almost  seemed   inevitable  because even  if   both  sides just   stopped their fire  and go   back  to  how it  was in   October 6th.  in  Israel.  There's an  inability to   live  with  hizb  that was   called  the red 1 Force as   their main  Commando  units  Sitting On  the Border. able   to  carry out in October  7th  attack  similar to  what   Hamas carried out so  very   likely  we're going to  have   to  see something that   breaks  the status  quo.  It   seemed  a couple  weeks ago  that  that  maybe some  sort   of  diplomatic  solution   because neither Israel  nor  hizballah have  an  interest   in  a war right now,  so   maybe hizballah would agree  to  move  north.  a certain  amount  of  miles and that   would be  enough  to  satisfy  Israel and that would be  A  diplomatic  solution  right  now.  It  seems further It   seems that  both  sides have   moved away  from  that  each   of  their own internal   political reasons.  in   Israel, Nathaniel was under  a lot of  pressure  from  his  coalition to  keep  the war  going So  he's  also  backed   away  from  that  a little   in  Lebanon his  balance under a lot of   pressure  from  Iran. to   keep  the war escalating  and  therefore they've also   backed  away  from  that   a little  so  it  does  seem   on  the 1 hand  like  it's   somewhat  inevitable  on   the other hand. It's   important to  remember   neither side, really  wants  it. So. both  sides.  may  look  for a way to  climb  down  from  their tree.  That's  what  this  the US   Special Envoy to  the region.  is  returning to  Israel   next  week. Theoretically  he's  trying  to  just  find   that  find  the formula.  to   make  both  sides say  you know  what? I can live   with  that  See I pushed   back  enough  or  saying   see I I did not do   everything  Israel  wanted  I  only  moved back  2 miles or   something like  that. to get   both  sides say you can come   down  because 9 side  really   has an  interest. but it   remains to be seen  because  at the same point both  sides  are really  locked  in  this   low intensity back  and forth  right now a report  came  out  in  Israel  today.  thing  that  Israel  has a dilemma  if  in fact the truce with   with  Hamas comes into   effect. in  November. when   the truth came  into  effect.  we  fire  as  long  as  the  war is  going on  right now.   This is a truce and Israel   also  stopped firing  because  Israel  said, okay, we're  just  returning fire  for  fire, but right now like   I said  Israel's saying no   we  actually  need  it's  not  enough  for us  to  say  there's no  fire  we  need   to  move  back  So  is   Israel  going to  stop  the  fire  with  Hezbollah for  6 weeks?  if  there's a truce  Israel  saying  maybe not.   remains to  be  seen. Last   thing I want  to  hit before   we go here, uh  the United   States  has approved. plans  for a multi-day strike. and  Iraq  and Syria against  multiple  targets including  Iranian person, uh  personnel  and Facilities  that  was a  CBS news  report  today that   said  that  citing us  officials.  Um, this  comes  after that  attack  in   Jordan  that  killed  3  American soldiers.   nothing has happened  yet  alone.  Uh, so  we're just   working off of  this  report   here, but if  this  is  in   line  with  what  the US   eventually  does  what   type of potential targets are  in  Iraq  and Syria There are  lots  of  Iranian Targets in   both  of  those countries  Iran  has so  many   interests.  in. Iraq  and  Syria in terms  of  its  militias. in  terms of   diplomats.  in  terms of   banking.  in  terms of   Simply  training  facilities   for his different militias,  So  there is  a plethora  of   targets.  It's  very   interesting to  see what  is   happening with  this   situation.  with  Iran   because Iran  seemingly for  all of  its rhetoric.  seemingly is  very  actually   scared  of  a regional   escalation  right now.  Iran   is  the 1 who likely  ordered  the Hezbollah and Iraq   brigades. to  make  a public   announcement. that  they're  no  longer  going to  attack   the United  States. That  is   the militia that  carried out  the attack  on  Tower  12 on Tower 22. They've said   were  there no  longer  going  to  carry that  out That  was  Iran's  orders. Iran  also   reportedly, pulled  all of   its Iranian revolutionary  guard officers  and also   secondary officers  out of   Syria.  in the  last  24   hours.  because they  were   fearful of  Israeli attacks  that  would drag  Iran  into   a war Iran. wants this low.  Regional  escalation  but  like  his Mala  doesn't  actually  want  to  engage   in  this  all out War So   what  we're probably   going to  see is  the United   States  attacking.  Iran.  Affiliated  targets.  not  necessarily Iranian targets  themselves. because the  United  States  does not want  to  enter into  the war with   Iran  either  But instead  we're going to see a   familiar Targets this could  anything  from  let's say  Iranian government  interests  in  oil development that   there's a plethora  of  such   targets.  in  Iraq, so   it's not  going to  be  an   attack  against Iran, but  maybe in  Iranian owned  Factory.  that's  owned by   the government. the Iranian  revolutionary guards  owns   tons  of  different economic.  manufacturing plants  and all  kinds of  things  like  that.  in  Iraq  and in  Syria,   maybe attacks against those  who will see attacks  against  things  that  are very   symbolic  probably  for Iran   or  their militias, but not  necessarily like  an  attack.  against an  Iranian.   military  unit  that  will   then  create  an  all out  War.  We're going to  see an   escalation. but still of   this  proxy war and things   like  that. is  my  estimate   at least  we'll be  waiting  to  see how the US  handles  this  situation.  uh, Dr.  Alone bursting  a UCI  visiting  assistant professor  and Israel  Institute fellow   also, regularly posting on   YouTube his own,  uh  daily  updates.

Thanks  to  forceful  IDF  action  the rate of Rocket   fire  has dwindled   dramatically  since the  start of  the war the IDF  continues to  focus its  efforts in  Khan Yunis   conducting  targeted  raids  to  dismantle Terror  tunnel   shafts  and enemy  infrastructure. it is doing  so  while operating against  Tara  holdouts  in  the  Northern  and Central strip  including Against terrorists   hiding  in  a school  and  exploiting  other civilian   infrastructure. in  flagrant   violation of  international  humanitarian  law.  an   update  on  unra  following  recent  damning Revelations  including the evidence  laid   before  the US  House Foreign  Affairs committee.  prime  minister  Benjamin  Netanyahu  has called  for other.  un   agencies  to  replace orra,  which has been  totally  infiltrated by  Hamas.  He   said  and acts  in  its  service.  meeting un   ambassadors yesterday.  the  prime Minister  called  for  the UN  to  understand  that   owner's Mission must  end.   Israel. wants to  see  humanitarian  Aid reach  civilians in  Gaza  who need   it. while making  sure  that   Hamas cannot  steal it  the  Prime Minister  therefore  underscored the need  for an   objective and constructive   body  to  deliver Aid to   civilians in  Gaza. We   totally reject  statements   from  un officials. That   there is  no  alternative to   this  Hamas front This  is   simply  poppycock The fact   is  unra  is  doing a  terrible  job at   Distributing  Aid.  its  leaders are covering  up.  their failure and their cover  up  of  Hamas by   scapegoating  Israel. our  neighbors in  Gaza  deserve  Aid agencies  that  will   serve them  and not  themselves  or  Hamas.  the  UN  already has Aid agencies   with  expertise in  emergency  relief  in  Conflict  zones.   to  date. However,  they   have  been  prevented from   operating in  Gaza  because  of  oro's Monopoly. these  viable  Alternatives  must   be  developed.  now.  so   that  Aid can be   distributed.  effectively and  professionally. of  being  routed through  an  agency.  That  is  not only   compromised by  terrorists.  but failing to  do  its job.   We  repeat  there is  excess   capacity  at  Israel's   Crossings for Aid to  enter  Gaza  the problem rests with   the Hamas front.  but  the world Community has  foolishly and scandalously   trusted to  deliver Aid to   civilians.  We think  it's   frankly deplorable  that   International actors  are  closing ranks to  protect  this  failed  agency. instead  of  working to  develop.   viable. effective and proven   alternatives. donors wishing   to  help  civilians in  Gaza   must  reroute aid funds  earmarked for unra  to   agencies  that  do  not.   employ. collude with  or   cover up  for terrorists.  those Alternatives  exist.   and it  is  way past  time   to  use them. meanwhile  Israel  also  calls for an   independent.  in-depth  and  transparent investigation  into  Honor's conduct in the   Gaza  Strip over  the years.   where confident that  the  results of  that   investigation will  shock  global  taxpayers.   but the revelation  of  how  their money has financed.  fueled  and covered up  for  terrorism.  for decades.  the  up for terrorism for decades   the UN  and its leadership   have  simply  been  ignoring.  evidence  for decades.   responding  instead by   smearing  and defaming  the  independent Watchdogs that   have been sounding  the  alarm.  under no   circumstances.  May donors   settle  for any sort  of   internal  un  review  of  its  own activities. in  light of   this  decades long  cover up.  an  update  now on  the  October 7 hostage crisis   yesterday prime minister   Benjamin Netanyahu  and  announced we  are working to   achieve.  another framework  for a hostage release and  explained his red lines  including no end to the war.   No  withdrawal  of  the IDF  from  the Gaza  Strip and no   release of  thousands of   terrorists  the prime  Minister  clarified Israel   remains committed to   achieving all 3 of  its War  aims, which are  non-negotiable  and which we   intend  to  achieve.   simultaneously. destroying   Hamas releasing the hostages   and making  sure  that  Gaza   can never again pose  a  threat  to  the people  of   Israel. Also  yesterday prime  minister  Netanyahu met with   representatives of  the  hostages  families   at the prime  minister's   office  in  Jerusalem.  He   assured them  that  the  government  is  making  every  effort  to  secure  the  release of  all the hostages.  noting  that  the more   discreet  those efforts.  the  greater their chances of   success.  an  important  reminder  about the numbers  253 people  were  abducted   on  October 7th.  253 not  approximately.  240.  of   those.  132 remain trapped   in  Hamas captivity.  joining  4 more  hostages  from   before  the war.  of  those  132 hostages  We  know  that   at least  29 are  dead. 28   murdered  in  Hamas  captivity.  and 1 killed  in   an  unsuccessful  rescue   attempt.  in  total Hamas has  murdered  at least.  36 hostages.  That  figure   was revised after the Israel   police  recently  announced  that  Sergeant   First Class ran Villi was  in fact killed  in  the  October 7 Massacre  with  his  body  then  abducted  into   Gaza  and Hamas now holding  it  for ransom.  time is running out for the  104 hostages  we  must   presume to  still be  alive  and those from  before   October 7th.  both  hostages   we  Fear  Hamas is  starving   and torturing and raping  and  executing in  its Terror   dungeons. We  repeat  our  demand  for the immediate and  unconditional release of  the  hostages  as  the  international court of   justice has called  for and  for unimpeded Access  for the  Red Cross.  until they  are  all.  safely  back  home.  That's  the end of  today's  update. We'll now take  your   questions as  always.  Thank you.  first question   comes from  Dan Williams  in   exchange  for normalization.   Saudi Arabia  wants at least   a nominal commitment  from   Israel  to the  creation  of   a Palestinian state is   Israel  prepared  to  make   such  a commitment. done.  I'll  refer you to  remarks  the Prime Minister  made   a few days  ago in  which he   explained his opposition. to   the notion  of  a Palestinian  State and explained the  importance  of  Israel's   security  control west  of   the Jordan  River.  uh   anything  short of  total  Israeli security  control  west  of the  Jordan  River.   would risk  a repeat  October  7th Massacre  on  a much   larger  scale we're talking  about territory 20  times the  size of the Gaza  Strip  Overlooking Tel Aviv   surrounding Jerusalem.   populated by  people. 0%  of   whom  according to  a recent   Doha  Institute poll.  believed  that  the October  7 Mass  was illegitimate.  That  is  the prime  minister's  stated  position.  next  question  comes from   Jim Williams  of  Zenga  International the Prime  Minister  told  the UN  Envoy  that  anra  must  be   replaced  at  the same  time   some  of  the UN  agencies   are asking  the Us  and other  countries to  resume  funding  is  this  putting a strain   on  Israel  to  help  getting  Aid to the  right people  in   Gaza. We  believe that   honor is  not a viable   mechanism for Aid delivery   in the  Gaza  Strip.  It is a  Hamas front it  employs  terrorists  that  allows   them  to  operate out of  its  facilities  and it   launderers their  talking  points  for Global   consumption.  The fact  is   it  is  simply  doing a bad  job Distributing  Aid it's   calling for more  entry  points  into  the Gaza  Strip  while asking  us  to  keep   kerem Shalom  closed  on   Saturday. Because we  are  facilitating  more  Aid than   they  are able  to   distribute. as  I said  in   the briefing  today the UN   has other Aid agencies  they   exist they  operate all over   the world in  other conflict   zones.  They  have  the  Manpower  they  have  the  expertise and it is time  to   put them  in  action  in  the  Gaza  Strip.  There are  people  there who as  we  are  consistently  reminded  by   the international Community  need  International Aid and  it  is  important that  they   achieve it  through  professional. agencies  and  not through the Hamas front.   That  is  unra  Hannah   Julian  of the  Jewish  press  asks  there are reports that   the state department  is   considering state of  a  Palestinian state or   at least  encouraging others   in the  International  Community to  do  so. and  also  Ming  extension on  a  vote  to  admit Palestine as   a full  member  state of  the  United  Nations How does   Israel? plan  to  respond to   such  actions?  uh  not  familiar  with  any specific   information on  that   Israel's  position  has been   very  clear.  about what  is   necessary for our security,  especially  in the  wake of  the October 7,  Massacre  We   thank the Biden  Administration  for its  stalwart  and steadfast  support.  since the beginning  of  the October 7 mass  since  the beginning of  the  administration. leading with   moral material  and  diplomatic  support.  Um, and  we're confident that  that   will  continue  and the  United  States  and Israel   will  continue  operating  side  by  side  as  an   unbreakable Bond  of   stalwart allies.  the next   question  comes from  Joel   Pollock of  Breitbart News.  Politico  reports that  the  hostage families  are being  advised by  Consultants who  are paid  by  Qatar is   Israel  concerned that  Qatar  is  not just  a mediator  but  is  also  intervening to   help  Hamas.  um   prime minister has  said   before  on  previous   occasions uh  Qatar has  leveraged.  over  Hamas as   Leaders it  hosts Hamas As   Leaders on  its soil. We  are  working with  Qatar  in its capacity as  a  mediator  in  light of  that   Leverage. and we  are fully  aware of  all the incumbent  complexities  in  that   arrangement.  the next   question  comes from  Leo  Soroka of the Washington   Post. Anna dollo  agency   reported  today that  the IDF  fully withdraws from   Northern  and western areas  of  North Gaza. Can you  relate  to  that? Uh  the IDF  announced recently  that  it   had succeeded in. completely   dismantling Hamas Terror   infrastructure  in  the  northern  Gaza  Strip and  dismantling Hamas weapons  production  capability  in   the central.  Gaza  Strip.   We  therefore shifted to  a  new stage of  the fighting.  our forces. However,   continue to Target  pockets  of  resistance  and Hamas and  Islamic Jihad Fighters.  inside  the Gaza  Strip  at the  Northern  areas  including a group of  Islamic  Jihad Fighters. Um, who were   operating out of  a school   and I'll  refer you to  the  statements  coming  out from   the IDF on  its telegram   Channels  with  ongoing  updates about operational  movements in the  Gaza   Strip.  Okay, that's  all  we have time  for today.   Thank you very much,   everyone. Have  a good   weekend and keep  safe.  Thank you very much.  and  that was  Israeli government   spokesperson  Alon Levy  holding his daily Israel   government  update  there on   day.

Fallout from   Israel's  ongoing war with   Hamas in  Gaza  joining us   live  this  morning to   explain more. is  senior   lecturer  in  criminal   justice and Homeland   Security. Mr. Ken Gray  is   always  good  morning to you.  Thank you for being here, Mr.  Ken.  Good  morning,  Janet  glad  to  be  with you   again.  So  I'm not going to   call  you a psychic Mr. Ken,   but you called it you did.   Close eye on  Lebanon because  a conflict  could arise How  did we  get to  this  point?   so  this  is  actually   something that  has been   in the  works.  ever  since  October 7th, if not,  even   before  then. Uh, the reason   I say that  is  after the  attack  on  October 7th the  Israeli War cabinet,  uh  was  recommending  going ahead and  doing a preemptive  strike   against Lebanon because they   knew  that  Hezbollah was  going to  be  a problem.   additionally. uh, Israel  has  uh, brought in  all these  reservists  and so  they   have  all the assets  in   place that  are ready to  go.  in  the event they  want  to   open  up  another front to   the north.  because of   exchanges between Hezbollah  and Israel. along the Border   there uh  70  plus  thousand,  uh  11  e have moved  away   from  the border  and 100,000  Israelis  have  moved away   from  the border  and the  exchanges that  have  been   going on  across  the border   has resulted  in  the deaths   of  uh, uh  over  a hundred.   uh  Lebanese. uh, Hezbollah  members and uh, several.  uh,  Israelis, uh  consequently,  this  is  a um, a a fight  that  has been  trying  to   break out throughout  the  period  since October 7th and  according to  a a senior   Israeli official  They  are  closer  now to  war with   Lebanon than  they  have   been  since October 7th.  so,  uh  within  the last  couple   of  days  there has been  an   increase  in the  exchanges  across  the border, uh,  Israel  conducted.  uh,  tax on 5  different targets.   uh  Hezbollah targets.  uh   along the border  there in   Lebanon.  uh, the 11, uh, the  uh, Hezbollah has been  uh,  uh  continuing  with  the  fire  missiles  and artillery  shells  into  uh, Israel. and  so  I I would say that  the  if  a war is  going to  break  out it  will  probably  break  out here  within  the next   month or so just  simply   because of  the fact  that   you have  uh, the Israeli,   IDF with  the extra  reservation all called  up   Uh, they  are.  starting  to   scale back  some of their  activities  in  the northern   part  of  Gaza. those assets   could be  moved up  to  the  water.  Uh, and uh  carry out  actions over. into  Lebanon  to  remove  the threat  of   Hezbollah just  like  the  activities  in  the Gaza   Strip is  trying  to  remove   the activities  of  Hamas.   uh  at the  same  time. uh,  Netanyahu is  in  trouble.   uh, he  has to  be  able  to   pull  in  the support.  from   the ultra right?  uh  part   of  the Israeli government.  and they  are very  much. in   favor of  taking  action   against uh, the Hezbollah  take  an  action  against  Hamas and so  in  many  ways   to  stay  in  political  power,  Netanyahu might have   to  expand  the war so  as   to  guarantee the support of   the far,  right?  I was just   about to  ask you this  we   have  so  much  going on  We   have  the Israel  Hamas War  the stuff unfolding in  Gaza   the stuff with  unra  those.   accusations of  those un   staffers  actually  helping.   Hamas now this  uh  saying   that  the stuff with  Lebanon  escalating  then  we  can't  forget  the Red Sea with  the  houthi  rebels  could this   mean  a regional  conflict   at  this  point?  so  we we  have  been  on  the verge of   a regional  conflict  ever   since October 7th.  uh  that   that  many  efforts have   been  taken to  try to   contain it  within  the Gaza   Strip and yet the the  hoodies,  uh, continue  their  harassment  of  shipping.  inside  the Red Sea.  uh,  just  uh  yesterday the  hoodies.  launched  drones   and missiles, uh  against  both  the commercial  ship   and against uh, the the  Kearney,  uh, the USS Carney.  responded by  shooting  down   the missile and taking  out  the drones, Uh, they  did  carry out.  did carry the  hoodies also. attacked  a uh   an  oil tanker, uh  inside   the Red Sea so  uh, that  is   1 area  of  conflict  that   continues to  Bubble  Up.  additionally. the newest   thing between the United   States. and Iran. the  President Biden has  guaranteed  some  type of  response. uh  for the death  of  the 3,  uh  US   servicemen. uh, and so  we   have  yet to see  what  that   Target  is  going to  be  but  uh, Iran, has assured the  United  States  that  if  any  action  is  taken within   Iran  proper  that  they   will  respond accordingly.   And so  the possibility of   this  boiling over  into  a  regional  conflict  remains  very  strong. and we  may be   sleepwalking  into  a  regional  War.  Goodness.  Well, I know  many  people   are on  the edge  of  their  seats as  you say that  but  we  definitely  appreciate   you joining us  here  on   live  now from  Fox Mr. K to   keep  us  informed  as  so   many  events  are unfolding  out in  their area  Before  I  Let You Go, Is  there  anything  else  you'd like   to  add?

Um,  uh  Netanyahu says  that   that  they're still remains a  big gap.  He  says  that   they  have  to  do  3 things.  uh, and uh  to  keep  their  eye on  3 things  and that   is  he has to free  the  hostages  get rid of  Hamas  and guarantee that  the Gaza   and the Palestinians  will   no longer be  a threat  to   Israel  And so  that  may be   a complication. uh  for this   ongoing negotiation to get   the hostages  out but the  families  of the  hostages   in  uh, Israel. are really   starting  to  make  their uh   their concerns  known and so   this  uh, additionally  is   bringing  pressure  on   Netanyahu from  the left. as   opposed to  support from  the  extreme,  right to  continue   their fighting  so, there's  politics  involved  in  this   as  well  as  the military   aspects.  great perspective  and information,  Mr. Ken.

bigger enemy kisala the war in the North is against kisala and all of us reservists and I am amongst them are ready to return and fight when we are called but yes I am being released from the reserves for the time being back to my family and work by work I mean producing a lot of quality content for you so please share and follow us the IDF moves to the third stage of the war in the third stage we are supposed to move to what has been defined as raids and remote attacks the IDF will not leave the Gaza Strip at this stage raids will be carried out based on intelligence information and remote attacks will destroy infrastructure remaining in the areas in which the IDF has finished fighting the reason these targets were not destroyed before is that they did not pose an immediate threat and there was a desire to advance the ground maneuver as mentioned this phase will last about four months and then we will enter the fourth and Final Phase of stabilizing the Gaza Strip the IDF will have to redefine the borders and the new security elements to ensure security for the residents of Israel this phase should also take about 4 months which means that the war plan is still ahead of us several elements could change the plan along the way way one thing that is currently unclear is the effect of opening a campaign in the north against kisala the IDE have received clear goals the elimination of Hamas which includes the elimination of the military and governmental infrastructure the termination of the leadership and the return of the Israeli hostages in terms of achieving the goals we are roughly halfway there let's believe in God and he will lead us safely during these unclear stages let's hear a little bit from my friends from the field who fought together with me during

commit acts of Terror against Israel kisala is trying to divert our attention from the war in Gaza disrupting the life of Israeli residents of the north the aggression and attacks carried out by kisala are fully backed by Iran and are the service to the Iranian regime that wishes to harm Israel over the last three months kisala has attacked the North of Israel relentlessly firing Rockets mortars and anti-tank missiles at Israeli communities and Military outposts these acts of terrorism are taking place in parallel to Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza have led to an internal displacement of many Israeli civilians who have not been able to safely return to their homes therefore the IDF responding in self-defense has engaged in very intense fighting on the Northern front with the goal of reshaping security of the area that residents of the north can safely return to their homes this is the Lebanese border and this is the area of thousand Lebanon where the Lani and zaran river flow according to the UN Security Council resolution 1701 following the second Lebanon war the presence of armed kisala operatives south of the Lani river is prohibited despite the UN resolution kisala turned sou Lebanon into its main stronghold and build a number of Terror systems in this area from military posts to military bases to weapon facilities while launching rockets that threaten the state of Israel as the Gaza War Began understanding that kisala may seek to perpetrate Terror against our population we deployed a large number of Land Air Naval intelligence forces along the northern border and indeed kisala launched attacks against Israel and joined the war in response to this attacks and using preemptive strikes the IDF has been operating to destroy their operational capabilities in sou Lebanon since the beginning of the war the IDF has carried out three main efforts in the north the defensive effort during which we have created a new defensive measures along the border the offensive effort during which we have targeted kis bala's forces and are damaging its military capabilities and the Readiness effort to prepare for a war on the northern border since October 7th we have been engaging in a new defensive effort along the border with Lebanon to protect residents of the north and damage kis bala's capabilities in this context we have deployed three divisions along the border we are preventing kis bala's attacks along the border attempting to enter into Israel to fire anti-tank missil towards Israeli communities IDF positions and to launch rockets at Israel so far we have struck more than 150 terrorist cells and eliminated over 200 terrorists and commanders in South lebano our policy is clear those who pose a threat will be targeted the second effort is our offensive operations since the start of the war we have struck over 3,400 military targets belonging to the kisala terrorist organizations across the sou and Lebanon looking at the sou Lebanon it is a complex area with several towns and communities most of which are connected to the Shia population in Lebanon like Hamas kisala has also embedded its terrorist infrastructure with the civilian population in Lebanon to make it difficult to Target kisala military assets our strikes are carried out based on precise intelligence with the goal of damaging kis bala's capability not causing harm to the civilian population we know how to strike any site used by kisala for terrorist activities we are striking three main group of kisala targeted the first is kis bala's forces along the border this includes kis bala's observation and offensive positions which are used to attack Israeli communities we have targeted about 120 OB observation positions along the border the second group of targets is kis bala's weapon storage facilities these facilities are used to store various weapons including missiles with various ranges uavs weapons and explosives since the beginning of the war we have targeted destroyed about 40 weapon storages that kisala heed along the border kis bala's weapon storages facilities were struck you can see the second explosions caused by the detonation of the missiles stored in this site the third group of targets is kis bala's military command and control centers which are the heart of the organization's military activities used to manage attacks kis bala's forces against Israel in both war and routine situation so far we have struck over 40 command and control centers used by Terror operatives we are also targeting significant Central infrastructures belonging to kisala including the terrorist organization aerial unit responsible for launching uavs towards Israeli territory in one strike we targeted an air strip used by the unit and eliminated the head ofis bala's thousand Lebanon aerial unit in this video you can see terrorists unloading uavs from a vehicle moving them into civilian building in the heart of a Lebanese town and preparing them for a launch the Israeli Air Force strike the terrorists and stopped the launch attempt kisala endangers the residents of sou Lebanon and we will continue to operate to prevent the terror of kisala there as well we struck a facility used to store Advanced surface to a missiles that balah intending to harm operations of the Israeli Air Force the IDF has been striking other sensitive targets belonging to kisala which I cannot detail to for security reasons in parallel to strikes in Lebanon we are operating to stop the supply chain ofis bala's weapons and missiles most of these weapons are smuggled by land and air from Iran to Syria and from there into Lebanon in clear violation of UN resolution 1701 Iran provides weapons to all the proxies in the Middle East these weapons are not only used against the state of Israel but against all of the Middle East we have witnessed Iran's Proxes posing the threat to both Regional and international stability occasionally Hamas operatives in Syria attempt to smuggle weapons into Lebanon we identified these deliveries and targeted them using various methods which I will not detail before they reach kisala we are targeting kis bala's infrastructures in Syria as well since the beginning of the war we have struck more than 50 such targets across Syria from the air and the land we are also operating to ensure our operational achievements and to prevent kisala from rebuilding we will continue to operate wherever kisala is we will continue to operate throughout the Middle East preventing all threats on Israel what is true for Lebanon is true for Syria and it is true for additional places further away for example about a month ago we eliminated kisala s in Syria the third and final effort is increasing our Readiness for war while we would prefer diplomatic Solutions we will not hesitate to respond with Force war is not our first priority yet we are ready for it for the past three months the northern command is cooperating with the Israeli Air Force the intelligence the Israeli Navy and other branches of the IDF has been conducting a series of training and exercises to ensure that if given the order we can transition to an immediate and significant operation all the efforts I have described have already LED an improved security situation in the north which will continue to take shape in the future we will not return to the security situation on October 6th when kisb threatened Israeli civilians in the north and deceived the world kisala made grave mistake when he decided to stand with Hamas partnering with kidnappers and rapists who carried out an unprovoked and immoral attack on Israel we have made the decision to focus on Gaza and the efforts to dismantle Hamas this decision is still valid that is where where the 136 hostages are and our ultimate mission is to bring them home just as we are responsible to keep our citizens safe kisala is responsible for the price the Lebanese civilians May pay kisala is turning sou Lebanon into a terrorist stronghold just as we have fought against Kamas strongholds in Gaza we will not accept the danger posed to our residents and we will fight kisala and all other terrorist groups that wish to harm Israel we will return to security using all means at our disposal"}, "mhPjnTu1lUs": {"url":

And since World War II, the US has provided more foreign aid to\nIsrael than any other country. But today, there are\nincreasingly vocal calls for more scrutiny of that\naid from the left wing of the Democratic Party, including threats to scuttle Biden's\nrequest for $14.3 billion in additional assistance to Israel. - It's changing the nature\nof the discussion now. It was once frowned upon to\ncriticize Israel publicly, and now you're seeing more and more that people are doing so, and those calls are\ngetting louder and louder. - This is a simple\nrequest for information. - [Narrator] On January 16th, Senator Bernie Sanders introduced\na resolution that sought to impose conditions on\ncontinued aid to Israel. - It simply requests a report on how USA aid is being used. This is a very modest,\ncommon sense proposal. - Sanders' resolution\nwould freeze aid to Israel unless the State Department\nproduced a report within 30 days, examining\nwhether Israel has committed human rights violations in Gaza. - What is going on in Israel\nright now is being done significantly with US military aid. So the 2,000 pound bombs\nwhich have the capability of wiping out entire neighborhoods, those are American bombs. - [Narrator] As expected,\nthe Senate overwhelmingly rejected Senator Sanders'\nresolution in a 72 to 11 vote. - We can and should continue\nto push Israel towards a targeted prosecution of the\nwar against Hamas and Gaza, but passing this resolution\ndoes not do that. In fact, I would say it is\ncounterproductive to it. - Are we complicit? And the answer obviously is yes, we are. And that's why I brought\nup this resolution. And I and other members\nwill continue to fight for accountability from Israel. - [Narrator] Even though\nthe resolution failed, it represents a historic level of scrutiny for USA to Israel. - Just the fact that\nthe Senate is now forced to debate this issue publicly really shows that there's a changing tide. Even if it didn't go anywhere and it was overwhelmingly rejected, the fact that senators\nare now forced to grapple with this question publicly\nshows that there is increasing pressure to do more.\n(light music) - [Speaker] An historic moment for Zion, which is celebrated in\nWashington at the office of the Jewish Agency for\nPalestine, as a small boy runs the flag of the new\nJewish state out on the staff. - Well, 1948, the United\nStates was first country in the world to recognize Israel. - [Philip Jessup] The\nUnited States recognizes the provisional government\nas the defacto authority of the new state of Israel, - But there really wasn't\nfinancial assistance attached. There was a little bit of money, loans to help resettling all\nthe people into Israel. And of course, this was still\nright after the Holocaust. - [Speaker] Many had suffered\ngreat hardships in the past. She, for instance, was evidently\nonce merely a number in some Nazi (indistinct). - Which was an important\npart of the context for the creation of Israel. - [Narrator] In the 1950s and '60s, the US provided the new country\nwith economic aid. But by the early 1970s, US aid became mostly military assistance. (artillery firing)\n(uptempo music) In 1973, two Soviet client\nstates, Egypt and Syria, launched a coordinated\nsurprise attack on Israeli forces in the Sinai and the Golan Heights. Israel ultimately repelled the attacks and regained lost ground, but only after the US made the decision to supply the Israeli military. - [Interviewer] Are you satisfied with the amount of\nequipment you're getting from the United States? - I am very happy with what we are getting and very thankful for that. - In 1973, Israel was\ndefending itself against two Soviet clients. That created an incentive for the United States and\nIsrael to align more closely. The real pivot came after\nthe Camp David Agreement - [Speaker] Signed at the White House by the leaders of Egypt,\nIsrael, and the United States. After decades of mistrust and warfare, it looks as if American diplomacy\nhas finally made possible a formal peace treaty between\nthe two old adversaries. - That really created a very different relationship with Israel, a very different American\nsecurity commitment to Israel. And it was also the 1970s where Israel went from\nbeing a somewhat partisan, mostly democratic cause, to being a bipartisan national issue. - [Narrator] For decades, US economic aid to Israel helped support\nthe Israeli economy. But since the rapid expansion of Israel's economy in\nthe 1990s, US economic aid to Israel began to\ngradually phase out in the 21st century. - So there was a shift over\ntime, agreed to by both sides, where the American assistance to Israel, which had been balanced after the Camp David Agreement\nin 1979 between economic and military assistance, became\nonly military assistance. - [Narrator] Part of America's strategy in the Middle East is ensuring\nthat Israel maintains a qualitative military\nedge over its neighbors. This approach involves\ngiving Israel first access to or more advanced versions\nof US defense technology. It also offsets military\nsales to its neighbors with increased weapons packages\nor military aid to Israel. - What this means is that when the neighbors\nwanna buy a weapon system, the United States oftentimes\nof has to arrange to also sell that weapon system to Israel. (artillery fires) - [Narrator] Annual foreign\nmilitary financing grants from the US represent about 16% of the Israeli military budget. - So let me share with\nyou why making sure Israel and Ukraine succeed is vital for America's national security. You know, history has taught us that when terrorists don't\npay a price for their terror, when dictators don't pay a\nprice for their aggression, they cause more chaos and\ndeath and more destruction. In Israel, we must make sure\nthat they have what they need to protect their people today and always. - [Narrator] Last year, President Biden requested $14.3 billion in additional assistance to Israel. A $14 billion funding request\nwould provide an additional $10.6 billion for the Pentagon\nto better equip Israel. The US military response to the Hamas attack includes ammunition and interceptors to replenish\nIsrael's Iron Dome system, which is the bedrock of\nthe country's defense. - Israel and America are\nconnected now and forever. - [Narrator] Historically, US aid packages to Israel have faced little\ntrouble getting through Congress because Israel has long\nenjoyed bipartisan support. - Peace requires compromise, but we will never ask Israel to compromise its security. Can't do that.\n(audience applauds) - There has been remarkably\nstrong bipartisan support for aid to Israel, but for\nthe last five to 10 years, we've seen increasing signs, certainly on the Democratic\nside in Congress, that maybe it needs to be qualified. Maybe it needs to be\nconditioned in some way. - [Narrator] Despite the\ndifferent mood in Congress, it remains likely that\nBiden's new security package to Israel will pass the Senate. - Israel has to end the threat of Hamas. Hamas is evil. If Hamas is left to its\nown devices, they will do to Israelis everywhere\nin Israel what they did to Israelis on the Gaza... along the Gaza Strip, - We're gonna support our\nclose friend and ally, Israel. - The US has decided that providing aid to Israel is just a fixture\nin its foreign policy. One thing that I have talked to officials about in\nrecent weeks is, you know, \"Are there gonna be\nconditions at any point? You criticize Israel's actions. So what do you tell them behind the scenes to sort of hold them accountable? Would you withhold military aid?\" And the answer I get generally is no. It's not even a question. - [Narrator] For his part,\nSenator Sanders intends to continue scrutinizing\nthe military assistance the US provides to Israel. - Do not count me in to\ngive another $10 billion to a right-wing extremist\ngovernment in Israel. It's a start, but I\ncan tell you absolutely that there are many more\nmembers of the Senate who are really upset about what is going on in Gaza right now.

and sometimes it's not easy to separate fact from fiction in US politics this week there was a story swirling about that Michelle Obama would take over from Joe Biden uh we'll get to that story a little later but let's head to the United States and joining me is the Boston Globe Deputy DC bureau chief tal copen good morning our time welcome to the program and of course this is we've just seen the story of the three k US servicemen it's a a huge story and particularly for the President Joe Biden yeah absolutely you know the the conflict that has broken out in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas which sort of seemingly by the day threatens to spiral into a broader conflict has really become a really all-consuming force in domestic politics uh when the president travels he's being greeted by protesters uh who in in large part are mostly supporting Palestinian rights and and criticizing his support of Israel but we've seen also Biden being a little bit sort of more critical of Israel than we have in recent days including sanctioning uh some settlers for violence in the West Bank so you're really seeing Biden trying to kind of thread this needle but now that you have you know attacks by proxies believed to be connected to Iran there's a very delicate balance of you know resp resp and also uh risk of further configration in the Middle East which no one wants absolutely now we' got some live pictures there of Joe bden in Delaware but he has been campaigning in Michigan and it's interesting Michigan of course was one of those very important states in the last election uh High U numbers of Arab Americans in Michigan and there were protests when he was there yeah absolutely in the Arab community in Michigan his really put Biden on notice it's a very complicated State it's a blue collar State uh he just President Biden just won the endorsement of a very powerful Union that represents Auto Workers uh Michigan is sort of Ground Zero for auto manufacturing in the US so that's a critical endorsement that helps in the state but then you have the Arab Community there's also a Jewish community in Michigan I mean there are a lot of different constituencies uh a large number of black voters in Michigan that Biden is trying to reach and and it is one of the very small handful of states that can tip the balance of the election thanks to our electoral college system here in the states uh you know there there are a few where even a swing of 10 20,000 voters can tip the balance of the entire presidential race and so it's it's definitely a state we would expect both campaigns uh the presumed nominees Donald Trump and and Joe Biden to pay a lot of attention to and recent polling in the state has not been good for Joe Biden and that's not entirely just the Arab Community I mean it's it's it's sort of all of the above constituencies uh coming together so that's a place that he's going to need to show up support if he wants to get another term in office it's very interesting to look at the polls because I read a piece this morning in the first half of it was saying that uh Donald Trump's got things to worry about because the polling is going the way Joe Biden the second half of the piece was from another poll where it said that Donald Trump was ahead of Joe Biden yeah I mean we're months from election day so you know take any polling with a grain of salt uh but at the same time you know the campaigns are looking at this and trying to figure out where are their weak spots where where do they need to kind of shore up support and there are certainly some that are showing warning signs uh in Michigan but you know there's also a phenomenon in the US this is not this is not a popular matchup uh there are a lot of Voters who are not happy to see Joe Biden versus Donald Trump on their ballots come November I think there are a lot of Voters that are still in denial that that is actually going to be what's going to happen in November the primaries are technically not done even though it seems that Donald Trump has run away with it on the Republican side and there's not really a serious Challenge on the Democratic side so you know there's a lot of room for change we'll see what the economy does we'll see what happens when voters actually confront the reality that is facing them in their choice in November the role of independent candidates uh many many months to unfold uh but certainly you know the polls are are snapshot and time as we always say absolutely it's going to be dramatic 2024 no matter how we look at it now I did mention in the intro this story about Michelle Obama do you think it's uh just a fanciful Hollywood tale or is it a possibility that Michelle Obama could replace Joe Biden I don't even know if Hollywood bu would buy it quite frankly it's mostly a Twitter conspiracy theory I mean it's it's not not a real thing uh for anyone for whom that possibly bursts a bubble but but no I nice headline Joe Biden is Joe Biden is the presumed Democratic nominee and that's that's not a likely scenario all right now US Federal Reserve has left its official cash rate on hold for the fourth straight meeting um but look it does look like that rates will change and be cut throughout the course of 2024 that's certainly something uh many folks are hoping for uh you know the housing market right now in the US is is pretty uh which means pretty expensive it's the interest rates really affect mortgages there are many Advocates who want to see it come down if only to you know deal with the affordable housing crisis that we have not to mention you know borrowing and lending but the the Federal Reserve has been um relatively conservative on this front but it does seem like they've at least ceased their campaign of hikes as inflation in the US has come down uh so it's certainly something a lot of folks are watching to see if at some point they decide okay they can actually bring interest rates down and not just hold them steady and then what the broader sort of cascade effects of our economy will be if those interest rates come down including in the housing market yeah that could really help Joe B Biden of course there's a a real lens not only in the United States but here in Australia on cost of living and economics thank you so much for joining us on the program I look forward to having a chat real soon thanks so much for having me"}, "VEvlRLaSQTU": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEvlRLaSQTU", "video_id": "VEvlRLaSQTU", "description": "In this episode of Worldview, we discuss where

on Israel and Israel's bombardment of Gaza began the situation is growing more complex and spreading in different ways that affect India so where does New Delhi stand on each of the [Music] issues hello and welcome to worldview at the Hindu with me sasani Heather we return to the conflict in Gaza this week where despite talks for another ceasefire and the the bombardment of Gaza by Israeli Defense Forces who are on the ground in the territory continued for a fourth month now if you were to look away just from those very very disturbing images we see coming out of Gaza and just look in terms of the numbers here are the top five statistics you should know since October 7th when 1200 isra people in Israel were killed in a series of brutal Terror attacks Israel's reprisal has killed 26,500 people about 6 5,000 are injured or missing 1.9 million or 85% of gaza's population is internally displaced mostly living in Refugee shelters 80% of the labor force is currently unemployed Unos sat images show that by the end of November 2023 so just within 2 months more than 37,000 buildings had been damaged among them hospitals schools and universities in Davos an official said that just to rebuild those homes will cost about um 5 billion now take a look at the GDP of Gaza in 2023 the GDP per capita in Gaza shrank by 26% it stands at onethird of its peak in two 2005 uh much of that has shrinking has come after October 7th now antad the UN agency actually has a report estimating that even assuming that the military operation ends immediately reconstruction starts straight away and GDP growth goes to 10% the GDP per capita of Gaza will return to its original levels or before 2022 uh only by 2028 and perhaps only to its peak Levels by 2035 so that's a real step back and you can read that entire antad report online estimating the damage so far from the initial violence and the initial response by Israel the conflict has moved in so many ways and many of those have had an impact on India I'm going to give you five the initial Global focus on the war of on terrorism shifted rapidly with civilian casualties in Gaza Rising uh India had remember in October abstained from one resolution calling for for an immediate ceasefire but it reverted to its old stand by December voted for a resolution along with 152 Nations calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire that was in December the second part we've been watching Hui attacks from Yemen um on Israel by missile drones but then they grew into a blockade of the Red Sea trading corridors and the Indian Navy is being called in to help rescue ships it has stationed at least a dozen warships east of the Red Sea in addition to its other anti-piracy uh programs in addition the break between Israel and Arab states as a result of this as well as the Red Sea crisis have led to a pause in two major Indian initiatives the i22 which is Israel India us UAE and us as well as the imch the India Middle East economic Corridor to Europe that was launched in the G20 now if you take a look at the map you can already see how the conflagration is growing across the region um to begin with Israeli strikes on Lebanon Iran backed houi targeting Israel the terror bombings in Iran Iran's missile strikes on Iraq and Pakistan the US and UK strike on Yemen Israeli strikes on Iranian officers in Syria and then a drone strike that k killed US soldiers in Jordan with this kind of regional instability inching closer to India uh we saw external affairs minister SJ Shanker actually traveled to Teran for some very important talks there with his counterpart the global South has been become increasingly critical of Israel and this is another area where India is being affected because India does want does seek a kind of leadership of the global South the international court of justice the icj last week handed down an initial ruling on South Africa's demand that Israel be tried for genocide while the court didn't accept the plea that it should call for an immediate ceasefire it did criticize Israeli ministers for their comments and of course has asked Israel to prevent acts of genocide and given six provisional measures for that meanwhile Israel has launched its campaign against the United Nations agency in Palestine the unrwa it accused 190 of 13,000 employees of direct involvement in Terror groups and the October 7th attack it actually uh identified about 11 of them so far according to reports the UN did move it terminated contracts it ordered a major inquiry but a majority of unrwa funders Us Canada Australia Britain uh Germany France Japan have all Frozen their funding for the moment uh saying they're outraged by these allegations now where does India stand on that here's what the mea said and remember India has been providing $5 million a year to UNR it increased that amount in the last couple of years and sent its last tranch latest tranch in December listening on the undraa we [Music] have you know India is an important development partner of Palestine we have been extending assistance to them both bilaterally and through the United Nations uh but at the same time we have a policy of zero tolerance towards terrorism and in this regard we are deeply concerned at the allegations that unva staff were involved in October 7th Terror attacks we also welcome the investigations launched by the United Nations in this regard so if I were to sum up just where India stands now when it comes to this conflict and all the various issues to begin with New Delhi has made the point of Zero Tolerance on terrorism it's called October 7th a terror attacks but it hasn't banned Hamas as a terror organization so far remember this is something Israel has been asking for uh some of its decisions may be Complicated by the fact that much of the Hamas leadership is seen in Qatar and India has an already complicated relationship with Qatar especially after the uh the case against the naval officers there second after what seemed like the initial shift towards is Israel at the UN General Assembly India has moved back to its traditional position of supporting Palestine criticizing Israeli settlements in every vote India has also expressed sympathy for Palestinians it's talked about the human cost and the suffering quite a lot but it is also preparing to send more than 50,000 laborers to fill construction jobs now those jobs came available because Israel has cancel Palestinian entry permits uh so they may actually be replacing them the impact of that kind of move one concern is could be on the 8 million expatriate Indians who live and work in the Gulf at present the fourth area India hasn't of course called on Israel directly for a ceasefire but apart from the UN resolution India was a part of a very strong non-aligned meat resolution it was called the kalala Declaration that soundly condemned Israel and the fifth India isn't mediating in the crisis uh but it It is believed to be passing on messages from one side to the other as it has also uh done by its own admittance during the Ukraine war now external affairs minister Jay Shanker has made it clear that India's position is squarely for a two-state solution this is something India has not budged on a two-state solution with Israel and Palestine living in peace next to each other but he said there are so many issues it is a basket it is not possible to pick one and the other and not choose to talk about some of the other issues listen in that there has to be a Palestinian State side by side with the state of is so for us today there are all these aspects you know we cannot take one aspect and say that's the only aspect I think we have to look at the totality of all these issues and strike the right balance and that is really uh in a way uh what what we are trying to so you need to look comprehensively at the issue so what's worldview take the unprecedented destruction of Gaza over the past 4 months has definitely pushed India back onto the tight rope walk between Israel and Palestine there is just too much at stake in the outcomes of the conflict including India's ties with the rest of the region the future of its major infrastructure corridors and the sources of Indian energy military hardware and remittances from expats for India to be seen coming down very heavily on one side or the other it's time for reading recommendations and we've been trying to get you new books each time this time I want to talk about some of the books that I will be discussing with the authors themselves in a panel discussion uh the first is the short history of Israel and Palestine from Zionism to intifadas and the struggle for peace this is by Michael Scott Bowman it came out in early 2023 um there is the next book is something called Crossing mandal Bal gate by kyberd who has written other books on the issues uh that you might enjoy the Palestine laboratory it's a strong critic of Israel it's it's called how Israel exports the technology of occupation around the world and this is by Anthony Lowenstein um there's a book on the history the tribes triumphant return Journey to the Middle East by Charles Glass Indians at herod's gate a Jerusalem tale this is by a former Indian ambassador to Israel naved sna and finally can we talk about Israel a guide for the Curious confused and conflicted by Daniel catch certainly enjoy hope you enjoy reading all of those and join us again here on worldview from the team here thanks for [Music] [Music] watching"},

details hundreds of tents are crammed together in Rafa hard against the border with Egypt this is probably the safest place for people who fled to southernmost Gaza to escape the fighting and bombing elsewhere it's estimated that half of the population of Gaza is now in the area but the Israeli Army is still attacking Targets in the city gaza's Hamas ran Health Services say 14 people were killed in one attack in Rafa on Saturday they tell people leave your home go to the zones considered safe but at the end wherever people go they get bombed why who knows it's just Revenge they just want to bring destruction to people that's all you can see the huge destruction in this area this shows its strength all the neighboring houses were affected meanwhile International attempts to negotiate a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel continue Hamas confirmed that it has received a proposal from Israel the US Egypt and Qatar but said it needed more time for a decision but there is no deal yet and Israeli defense minister YF Galan says his Ground Forces will also eventually Advance into Rafa something Israel's allies have strongly warned against German foreign minister analina bebok said a military operation against Rafa would not be justifiable and let's get more now from journalist hen belusa who was based in Gaza until he and his family evacuated in November he joins us now from the Jordanian Capital Aman hzm uh good to see you again we are hearing these reports that the Israeli Army plans to expand its offensive to Rafa um or rather in Rafa on the Egyptian border what more can you tell us about that this is still not certain uh there are a lot of statements coming from different sides mainly Israeli one and the Egyptian uh side which is very relevant um some statements particularly came from um Israeli defense minister who said that they would advance in but apparently according to the reports and and from different sources the Egyptians are not happy with that there are some reports that they would replace this plan uh replace this plan with the with more enforcement along the border um Egypt would build underground wall along the border between Egypt and Gaza uh other things the the the there was a report that talking them Israel asked Egypt to Rel relocate um um the RAF Crossings between Gaza and Egypt to the a place near Kim Shalom uh meantime Hasam uh Israel and Hamas are still negotiating a possible ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages what more do we know at this point about the status of those talks um a lot of reports nothing official coming but Hamas is saying that they are reviewing reviewing the proposal that submitted to them through kares and Egyptians there are two different levels of of discussion one is the internal Hamas they have different bodies they are discussing it within the bodies of of of the movement um another another level is discussing it with other factions particularly Islamic Jihad and other like pflb or dflp they want to as according to the statements from Hamas officials they want to uh show a one voice from the Palestinian side so it's not clear there are some reports that the Hamas answer or response will come out later today journalist hazam belusa joining us from Aman in Jordan with the latest on the situation there in Gaza thank you so much thank you let's bring in now Hiba TI she is the care acting Deputy Regional director for the Middle East and North Africa she joins us from Aman what options are there for the hundreds of thousands of displace people in Rafa if the Israeli Army extends its operations there thank you so much for this question unfortunately uh as you know and as we have seen in your report the options that are remaining almost uh for the people if they are moved out of RA are almost none uh these are this is the only remaining area where people are trying to secure themselves in a place that is uh that is um that is actually uh uh open for them to stay in with the minimum minimum not even enough uh services that exist if this place is going to be under military action there we are very afraid that there are no other places to go to no options to to use uh in Gaza talk with us a little bit more about the services and the aid because for weeks we have been hearing what the UN has described as pockets of famine in Gaza and diseases spreading what more can you tell us about the current efforts to reach civilians and provide help uh there are many actors in Gaza trying to reach as many people as possible among them is care uh all of us we try our best we try to secure uh services from outside from inside Gaza but what we do is still the same we use this uh uh terminology weeks and weeks ago Drop in the Ocean what we are providing now is still a drop in the ocean if the needs were already massive weeks ago they are extremely massive now the number of Aid entering is very very limited the possibility to distribute it is very limited in the north it's even almost not existence and the same is applied in the in the south in RAF and in the surrounding area the same is applied on kanun and other locations the the requirements are massive but what is happening in Gaza or entering is very very limited and little the international court of justice has ordered Israel to allow more Aid into Gaza what has your organization been noticing has there been any increase since then there are days where we see more Aid entering days with less Aid entering the highest number of Aid trucks entering in Gaza per day the highest number is as almost most half of the requirement in normal days before the war which means that we are still unfortunately facing very limited amount entering Gaza the requirements are massive as I mentioned with the winter entering more and more Aid is needed for uh winter items shelter items and medicine and this is not happening unfortunately the after the icj uh um uh announcements there was not much improved to answer your question we've been hearing and and Reporting today that Israel and Hamas um negotiations on a potential ceasefire are still ongoing um you mentioned a number of of things that are needed in Gaza what would be among the most urgent needs for civilians if there were to be any break in the fighting what's on the top of of the list for you it's very difficult to prioritize one item or two or even three everything is needed in Gaza food water fuel shelter medicine all of that is needed and unfortunately all of that is focused only on life saving and not even for for livelihood uh we don't even think about it right now it's only for life saving all these are considered priorities that we wish we are going to be able to secure in in any ceasefire or uh at least a short ceasefire in the coming hopefully days hi care acting Deputy Regional director for the Middle East and North Africa in Aman thank you so much for joining us on DW

evening and welcome share the big moves uh post that Gathering yesterday Iman I'm tempted to say uh we've seen the movie before and all we need to do here is rewind the tape right but that might just date me as an 80s baby yes you're absolutely right after that council meeting parties went into the uh closed door consultations uh and much later in the evening yesterday Algeria distributed its latest draft resolution uh that uh recalls the icj ruling right that uh in relation to the right of Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip to be protected but in the scope of Article 2 and three of that genocide Convention of 1948 it then lists a key demands right it demands an immediate humanitarian ceasefire reiterates its demands that all parties scrupulously adhere to the tenants and their obligations under international human rights and uh humanitarian law it rejects the force displacement of the Palestinian ation and it also reiterates a call for full rapid and safe and unhindered humanitarian access into Gaza right so uh you know a resolution will pass based on how the United States votes right as the key Israeli Ally in uh the security Council we got a sense from Linda Thomas Greenfield yesterday in that security council meeting how this might evolve in the days ahead let's play what Linda Thomas Greenfield had to say and then come back to me we must must be honest about what the court did not order specifically it has not ordered an immediate ceasefire it has not made any finding that this preliminary phase of the proceedings that Israel committed genocide or otherwise violated the genocide convention and indeed the United States continues to believe that such allegations are unfounded and that rather than try and will a ceasefire into existence when the conditions to sustain it unfortunately don't exist we must instead work toward a durable solution to this conflict through the hard work of on the ground Relentless diplomacy so when Linda Thomas Greenfield deand talks about uh the Relentless diplomacy on the ground she is seeking to give the United States and its allies a poit itical off ramp here pointing to diplomacy in the region as you well know there are parallel initiatives in the region led by the United States cter Egypt France and Israel in uh you know engaging Hamas in terms of a new ceasefire proposal that would see another hostage exchange for prisoners uh we understand this is a three-phase deal so in the first part of this deal some 35 to 40 hostages would be released uh including sick women and men over the age of 60 Israel would then stop fighting for a for a determined period uh and that would also see the release of some 200 to 300 Palestinian prisoners and then scaled up humanitarian axis the Second Step would be the release of the remaining abductees in particular military and and other officers soldiers that have been captured and then the third phase it would be sort of lead to what Hamas is seeking here which is an end to this war so the United States will point to those efforts this deal is on the table we could get news in relation to uh the parties to the conflict signing up to this uh framework and so uh there are two processes here uh the US will point to the Algerian resolution and highlight the fact that it doesn't mention the release of hostages it doesn't condemn Kamas which has been a red line in previous resolutions so uh you know the writing appears to be on the wall in terms of where the resolution can go but as I mentioned the US might point to other proposals including the ceasefire deal uh if the parties were to come to the table on that in in the interim future so what is sounds like Shen is there might not be a definitive decision from the UN but given what you shared there from Linda Thomas Greenfield that there is some space in between these lines for some kind of maneuver all the while though we have at the top of our minds what R mansur was saying to the security Council yesterday around what the numbers of this human catastrophe represent the hell that Palestinians are going through on a daily basis and that urgency is what is required to make sure that lives are spared and no more people uh will suffer but it seems as if there's going to be some distance quite considerable distance between what happens now and and that reality yeah the frustration of Riyad Mano in that meeting which we both watched right you it was palpable there is a great frustration a long-standing frustration from Palestinians in terms of inaction that is historic almost traditional within the security Council in terms of the Palestinian question he was beseeching uh uh the security Council to pass a resolution to affirm essentially what the icj has already ordered in terms of the genocide convention they believe a ceasefire is the only way you can Implement and give effect uh to the orders those six provisional orders that were handed down by the court the United States is arguing that you know a ceasefire proposal outside of the the realm of the security Council will in effect have uh the same uh uh uh impact on the ground they are focused on changing the calculus on the ground and they believe in terms of the inter their discussions in the region that this is the best bet to get Israel on board as you well know Iman uh Security Council resolutions have come and gone in the past and Israel has ignored them without uh any retribution from member states of the security Council due to uh the protective war that the United States provides to Israel so we might you know even if we were to get a resolution in this instance it might not in effect have the impact the the desired impact on the ground so it's important to watch both these processes because the end game here is about ending this war the end game here is about upscaling uh the humanitarian access into Gaza the end game here is to ensure that anra is capacitated that anra has the funds uh because essentially it provides the fabric of humanitarian access throughout the Gaza Strip it has the means it has the tools it has the understanding of the region and so there many many fact factors here uh that are at play but the end goal is very clear humanitarian access needs to be upscaled and the end game very much is about ending this war man we certainly will

justice on a cold winter morning of January 26th we will never let you die when hundreds rallied outside the world Court waiting for the verdict on South Africa's case of genocide against Israel the court considers that with regard to the present situation Israel must in accordance with its obligations under the genocide convention in relation to Palestinian in Gaza take all measures within its power to prevent the commission of all acts within the scope of Article 2 of the convention the court further considers that Israel must ensure with immediate effect that its military forces do not commit any of the aforementioned acts the interim ruling Drew mixed reactions from world leaders and commoners alike Israeli leaders dismissed the verdict yet again calling for Israel's right to self-defense like every country Israel has an inherent right to defend itself the vile attempt to deny Israel this fundamental right is blatant discrimination against the Jewish State and it was justly rejected the charge of genocide leveled against Israel is not only false it's outrageous and decent people everywhere should reject it other hail the Judgment as a much-needed acknowledgment of

ships in the Middle East right now we're America's a away team we're out here supporting American interest it being like big partners and team players with all of our allies here they bring us aboard the USS baton an amphibious assault ship patrolling the Eastern Mediterranean roughly 2500 Marines and Navy sailors are on board we see and hear them working at all hours we're on deck in the middle

6 hours and the goal is that that presence can prevent a wider [Music] war time and time again history has proven the value and utility of having four deploy Marines on amphibious ships the Baton had been in the Red Sea before being sent here just 500 M off the coast of Israel capable of mass evacuations and able to get thousands of Marines on the ground if needed it's a gargantuan task one we were able to see up close the well deck a massive hold that takes up a third of the ship can flood in just 20 minutes with the back of the ship open we sail out of the Baton on a landing craft utility an lcu we keep hearing about those unique capabilities of this ship and the Marines and Navy sailors on board and this is what they mean this is the lcu it's the craft that they use when they leave the USS baton and it's how they get thousands of Marines and their equipment from the ship to shore traveling alongside the Baton another major deterrent in the region a US Navy destroyer the air heading between the USS bat and the USS Navy's Destroyer here in the region arriving on Deck we witnessed the sheer power this Destroyer has on board this Destroyer is nearly identical to the one the

in the Israel Hamas War we don't want any non-state actors to become a part of that whether it be Hezbollah or the houthis we're here to ensure it doesn't escalate into a larger crisis or a larger war

International actors interested in seeing more Aid in Gaza should send more we still have a problem that un agencies are unable to distribute the aid as quickly as Israel is processing it and it is lamentable that un officials who have also been covering. up for the fact that Hamas hijacks Aid and covering up for the fact that it wages War out of hospitals. are trying to cover up their own systemic failure by demanding the when there is already adequate and excess capacity at the existing ones and of course we welcome the establishment of 4 new warehouses to enhance of the international organizations on the ground receiving the humanitarian Aid. more information as on the co mini site, which is regularly updated. uh with the latest details of the humanitarian Aid efforts. an update on the hostage crisis time is running out for the hostages We Fear are being tortured and raped and executed. in the Hamas Tara dungeons. latest figures remain unchanged of the 253 hostages abducted on October 7th. 132. remain in Gaza. 28 of whom we know. are already dead. There are another 4 from before the massacre. dating back to 2014. that was hostages have all been held in comunicado without Red Cross access. yesterday the prime met French Armed Forces Minister Sebastian LA cornue and noted that we in Israel are still waiting for proof that the medicines for the hostages. Which France actually reached their destination at all. today the knesset hood chilling testimonies from survivors of Hamas captivity. about the sexual abuse taking place in the Hamas Terror dungeons. Survivor. Hen Goldstein almog spoke. of hostages missing their periods. Uh, and she expressed her Hope that that is because their bodies are shutting down the possibility. of getting pregnant. while they are being raped. 19 of the remaining hostages are Goleta shansky is only 13. captivity Survivor Aviva seagull also told the knesset that men are also experiencing sexual abuse. She said their experiencing the same as the women they just Can't get pregnant. seagull whose husband Keith is still a hostage said that the terrorists captains are dressing up the girls as dolls. and quote. making the girls their dolls and doing whatever they want with them. whenever they want. We call on all countries means possible to release the hostages immediately and unconditionally. and secure access for the Red Cross until then. it shouldn't take courage for celebrities what Gwyneth Paltrow said, I think just yesterday and make it clear that rape is not resistance. That's the end of today's briefing will now take your questions as always. I think we already have a few in the chat. the first question comes from Leo Sokka The Washington Post Can you relate to the report on CNN that Israel leadership in Gaza would be granted safe passage to leave the strip as part of the broader ceasefire agreement. the goals of this war is laid out by the war cabinet after the October 7th, Massacre and handed down to the IDF remain. unchanged the destruction of Hamas is governing and Military capabilities in the Gaza Strip and the return of all the hostages. there will be no ceasefire that leaves the hostages in Gaza and Hamas in power beyond that we have nothing to elaborate. the next question comes from Jim Williams of Xena international news Is there any response to the EU calling for a proposed? peace conference to discuss what to do post-war and the eu's insistence on the establishment of a Palestinian State and as a reaction to the US and UK multiple attacks on the Iranian proxies in Yemen in hopes of protecting commercial shipping in the Red Sea. um first of all, I'll address the question about the uh houthi pirate threat as we've been saying since the beginning of their attacks on international shipping. This is a global threat and it's correct that the response should be uh Global we also note the remarks, uh by the British noting the direct involvement of Iran in funding and arming and providing support for the houthi attacks on global trade and it's important of course people understand those attacks in the context of the Iranian Imperial project. uh in the Middle East as for the question about the European Union and the moment we are focusing on destroying Hamas, Uh, and whatever. uh people's positions within Israel about how to achieve a secure peace with the Palestinians. everyone understands that that simply cannot happen. with Hamas. uh still on the ground and there needs to be a serious process of deradicalization in order to uh, make sure that uh, uh, we do not end up repeating this cycle of violence now the Prime Minister has made his position. clear He objects to the establishment of a Palestinian state that would serve as an ex. existential threat uh to Israel uh, especially in the wake of the October. 7, uh, Massacre now that we understand the true extent of the threat. uh that we are. the threat that we are facing potentially. Um, I mean I can elaborate more on the prime minister's thinking in that regard. Um. which is that anyone even the supporters of Palestinian statehood. When asked what that means whether they support the Palestinians having an army or military capabilities. Um, slightly reject that the prime minister's position is the Palestinians should have all the powers to govern themselves. and none of the powers to threaten Israel. uh would statehood mean that uh Palestinians could have uh joint military exercises or a mutual defense treaty with Iran or important North Korea and weapons Obviously these uh statements are absurd. Uh, but these are long-term questions that we are going to have to discuss after the war the question of how we achieve a secure. peace with our neighbors a piece that will require a serious push towards deradicalization. uh on the other side. And for now we are focused in United on destroying Hamas and bringing the hostages home. Joel Pollock from Breitbart News asks can you comment on the emotional impact of impact of such a huge loss. Does it make the Israeli public question the cost of the war or does it make the Israeli public more determined to press ahead to Victory? the emotional cost of waking up to such horrific news is of course intense Israel is a very small country. and that means that everyone in the country is now discovering how they are related or connected to those. 24 soldiers through multiple. degrees of uh separation. Uh, but the people in Israel understand very clearly why we are fighting this war, which is not a war of choice It is a war that Hamas declared on us. on October 7th with the massacre and the bloodiest Massacre of Jews since the Holocaust with an armed Invasion by air Land and sea and attack that they are threatening us that they want to do. again and again, and an attack that all of our allies as they understood on October 8th, uh, they understand that Hamas will not stop until it is stopped And fighting to dismantle Hamas military and governing capabilities and bring back the hostages because otherwise if we return to the lines of October 6th, it will only be a perpetrates another Massacre again. everyone understands. the Hamas Army of Terror exists for the sake of war and therefore for the sake of Peace it must go and that was Israeli government spokesperson Alon Levy as he was answering questions from members of the media.

IDF fatalities  since the  start of the  October 7th,   Massacre  remain constant.   at  556 since our last   update. an  operational  update  the IDF continues its  targeted  raids on  terrorist  sites in  Khan  Yunis and the  central Gaza  Strip as  part   of  its efforts to  dismantle  the Hamas Terror State   troops  destroyed a Tunnel   located.  only  1500 M  from   the border  a north south  tunnel  that  stretched for a  kilometer inside  the Gaza   Strip.  20  M underground we   repeat  our calls for  international  condemnations of  calls as   human shield  strategy  and  its despicable efforts to use  civilian   infrastructure above  ground   to  Shield. its military.  infrastructure  Underground.   deliberately  placing  civilians and their  facilities  In  Harm's  Way.   yesterday the IDF  DCL classified  intelligence   about coordination  between  Hamas military  wing  and the  guards   in education authorities.  exposing  how some  Hamas  terrorists  are Moonlighting   as  teachers. These were   official  letters addressed  from  the brigades  and  personally  delivered to the   head  of  the Gaza  education  directorate Dr. Muhammad   hamdan. those letters  requesting  that  the  teachers  be  excused for  military  service with  Hamas  and specifically  for  military  training  only  1  week  before  the October 7th  Massacre  those letters  of course raising serious  questions,  we  expect  the  International Community to   look  into  the original.  copies  of  available on  the  idf's Twitter.  a  humanitarian  update. Uh, we   note  British foreign  secretary Lord, Cameron's  call  for more  Crossing   points  to  be  open  for  longer  for Aid deliveries   including kerem shalom. in   that  context.  We  draw   your  attention to  the fact   that  kerem Shalom  has  excess  capacity  for Aid  deliveries  if  International  actors  send  it   we also know  That   kerem Shalom  is  currently  closed  on  Saturdays because  the United  Nations has asked  for it  to  be  shut  in   order that  it  be  able  to   process the pileup  on  the  other side. Unfortunately,   we  still have  an  issue  with  the UN  being unable   to  deliver Aid as  quickly  as  Israel  is  facilitating   it  and of course.   continuing  its omata about  Hamas.  hijacking Aid.  a  comment on  Honor's  allegations of  an  Israeli  strike  on  a Yuan  shelter  Wednesday after an   examination of  the idf's  operational systems the IDF  has currently ruled out.   that  this  incident  was the  result  of  an  aerial  or   artillery strike  by  the  IDF.  a thorough  review  of   the operations  of  our  forces  in  the vicinity  is   underway, The IDF is  also   investigating the possibility  that  the strike  was caused   by  Hamas fire  as   background, Of  course  we   remind  media of  the  consequences  of  false  reporting.  around  the  elahi hospital  when  it   turned  out that  it  was  tripel from an Islamic   Jihad,  uh  rocket  that  had  landed  in the   car park after  headlines had  gone  around  the world of  a  fake  Israeli strike  and we   urge. caution again before   reporting allegations from   Hamas or  Hamas affiliated   institutions. as  facts.   Finally yesterday in  a  speech  marking the 75th   anniversary of  the knesset  Prime Minister  Benjamin.  Netanyahu reiterated. that   our goals for this  war which  Hamas declared  remained   robust. to  end Hamas is   Rule  to  bring all the  hostages  home  and to   ensure  that  Gaza  never  again constitute  a threat   to  Israel  the Prime  Minister  added and I quote.   anyone. Who lifts her hand   against us  in  Gaza? Anyone?  Who lifts a hand  against us   anywhere? will  very quickly   feel  our power There is  not  nor will  there be  any  compromise  with  regard  to   safeguarding  our existence  and our future  for  generations to  come? end  quote that  brings  us   to the  end of  today's  briefing  and we'll now take   your  questions in the  chat   box.  Thank you.  the first  question  comes from  Melanie  lidman  of  AP  How are the  protests  impacting the  entrance  of  Aiden to  Gaza   How will  this  affect  the  number  of  trucks  going  into  Gaza  by  in  Karen  shalom? this  week  and are  there any actions being taken  to  try to  make  up  any  deficits  the IDF and coat   have  said  that  this  is  a  question  for the PM. Uh  as   far as  we  are aware,  Karen  Shalom  retains excess   capacity. for more  Aid to   enter into  the Gaza  Strip.   We've never placed  any  limitations.  on  food  water  medical equipment or  shelter  equipment.  uh  into  the  Gaza  Strip and that is  Israel's  policy. question   from  roulette  Huffer  Swiss  daily n z  Zed does Israel want to  establish a permanent buffer   zone  in  Gaza? 1 km behind  the border  to  allow for the  safe  return  of  inhabitants  of  the South.  The Prime  Minister  has been  clear  that  our goals for this  war  are the destruction of  Hamas  military  and governing  infrastructure  with  all  that  entails.  the return   of  the hostages  and  ensuring  that  Gaza  never  again.  pose  a threat  to   the people  of  Israel  We   have  been  clear we  do  not  intend  for the to be any  buffer  zone  in  Israeli  territory.  This war  will   end when  the residents  of the  kibbutzim that were  ethnically  cleansed  on   October 7th can sleep.   safely  in  their homes and  for that  we  are pursuing   the destruction of  Hamas  military  infrastructure   inside  the Gaza  Strip and  the creation  of  conditions   that  will  ensure   uh, that that cannot  rearise  and pose  a threat  to  the  people  of  Israel. Leo  Soroka  from  The Washington   Post  asks  can you relate   to  the different scenarios  of  the icj ruling  tomorrow?  And how will Israel respond  additionally, Dan Williams   asks  does  Israel  intend   to  heed  whatever  decision   the icj hands down  tomorrow.  Oh, we  know that the icj is   scheduled to  rule  on  its  provisional measures   tomorrow  We  suggest let's  wait  and see what  the icj  has to  say.  we  have   expected  it, of course to   throw out the course  absurd   and ridiculous  charges.  uh   pressed by  South Africa   will  remind  you that  while  the United  Nations.  says   that  in  urban Warfare  around  the globe.  90% of   casualties  are civilians,   and we're talking about a  civilian  to  competent ratio  of  9.9 to  1.  uh  it  is   of course patently  absurd   to  paint a conflict  with  a  civilian  to  accommodate  ratio of  around  1.5 to  1.   perhaps the lowest  civilian   to  competent ratio in  any  Urban Warfare in  history at   all.  as  somehow  however evidence  of  a  genocide  and we  expect  the  icj to  throw out these  spurious  and  specious charges. the next   question  comes from  Hannah   Julian  of  the Jewish  press  un  secretary.   General Antonio Gutierrez  continues to  insist  that   Israel  accepted   2 State solution  and  criticizes  anyone  who  opposes this  solution.  comment.  the Prime Minister   has already been  clear where  he  stands  on  this  that.  uh  in  as  much  as  we  are  able  to  achieve a permanent  resolution  with  our  Palestinian neighbors Israel   will  have to ensure   security  control.  west  of   the Jordan  River in  order  to  prevent the emergence of   the sort of terrorist or   military  threat  that  might  repeat  another October 7th  Massacre. It will remind  you  the West  Bank, Judea and  Samaria is  a large mountain   range that  overlooks  Tel Aviv  surrounds Jerusalem  leaves  Israel  only  9 miles  wide  between the Green line   and the Sea and only  4 miles  from  the top to  bottom  of   Jerusalem it  is  of course  inconceivable.  that anyone  else  might retain  security   Control in  that  area  and  use it  as  a base  for death  squads  to  invade  Israel   as they Did on  October 7th  and Israel  has no  intention  of  allowing. what  happened   in  farza to  repeat  itself   in  casaba. the next   question  comes from  Jodi   Cohen of  w i o n does   Israel  have  confidence  in   qatar's role  as  a mediator   to  try and release the  hostages. Um  Carter   maintains close contacts   with  the Hamas terrorist  organization  Israel  is   therefore working.  with   Qatar in  its capacity  as  a  mediator  with  Hamas and we   are of course.  fully aware  of  the incumbent  complexity in that  matter.  the second  question  from   Hannah  Julian  of  the  Jewish  press the UN  claims   Israelis throwing up obstacles within  the enclave and thus   slowing delivery  and  distribution  of  the aid.   comment.  We  think that   anyone  who is  truly  concerned for the  humanitarian  situation in   Gaza  and fate  of  civilians  should  demand  1 Thing.  but  Hamas should  surrender It   should  lay down  its arms   it  should  hand  over  its  war criminals.  It  should   release the hostages  and it   should  surrender.  That  is   what  anyone  who is   concerned for civilians.  Uh   should  do  and we  deplore  the fact  uh  that  as  un   agencies  and International  organizations,  go  to   extreme lengths to  deny   that  Hamas is  hijacking Aid  and Waging  War out of   hospitals.  They  are  deflecting  blame onto   Israel  to  cover up  the  fact  that  they  have  been   covering  up  for Hamas.   Elon  Ben Zion  from  AFP  asks  the icj is  expected   to  live  to  deliver a  ruling  in the  case  against  Israel  tomorrow. What  are  the possible  scenarios  Israel is preparing for and  already addressed this   question  from  your   previous  colleagues  just   a minute  ago.  Dr. Abby   korb  asks  good. Good   afternoon,  Elan. Is  there  any news  with  respect to   the mediation delivery? the  medication  delivery  ever   reaching  hostages. uh  the  last  statement that  came   out from  the prime  minister's  office  from  the  meeting with  the French   Armed Forces  minister. uh   is  having  thanked the  French  president for his  help  in  delivering  those  medications to  Gaza. We  are  still waiting confirmation   that  those medicines have   of course.  reached.  uh   their intended  address.  and  when  discussing  the context  of  the health  of  the  hostages  who are still  trapped in the  Hamas Tara   dungeons, I'll  refer you of   course  to  the extensive  medical report  provided  by   the hostage Family  Forum  stating that  a third.  of   the hostages  have  chronic  health  conditions  others   have  serious injuries   gunshot wounds  to  the hands  and limbs blown off they   require urgent. medical  attention and we  expect  the  whole world to  put all  pressure  on  Hamas to  allow  the Red Cross to see  the  hostages  and all pressure   on the  Red Cross as well to   Prussia Hamas to  see the  hostages  There is  more  it   can do  and it is regrettable  that  the Red Cross admits   that  it  cannot  even  be   bothered to pressure  Hamas  to  see the hostages. Dave   Bender  asks  where to  talk   stand on  a diplomatic   resolution  with  Hezbollah  in  Lebanon.  What  would  constitute  enough  of  an   attack  against Israeli  civilian  or  IDF targets?   to  force Israel  into  a  major military  response.  hasbulla  decided on  October  7th to  join. an  unnecessary  war on  the side of Hamas and  begin shelling  and reigning   rockets on  Northern  Israel.  That  shelling  has led  to the  displacement  of   80,000  Israelis  who cannot   return  to  their homes now  that  are being shelled we   warned  has ba  repeatedly   for 3 months. to  desist   that  we  do  not want  a war  on  2 front but we are   willing to  fight 1 if  we   have  to  to  defend  our  people  and we've been   saying  very  consistently   for weeks.  There is  still a  window  of  opportunity.  for  a diplomatic  resolution  to   this  crisis. for  resolution to back  off from   the Israeli Border  in   accordance  with  un   Security  Council resolution   1701  which has been   accepted  by  the government   of  Israel  the government   of  Lebanon and the UN   Secretary General uh, but  hasbulla  must  be  aware and  its Iranian warlord patrons  as well.  in  no  uncertain  terms that  we  will  not  tolerate  the ongoing.   displacement  of  Israelis   from  their homes and  shelling  and Rockets on   Northern  Israel  and if   Hezbollah does  not back  off  we  will  be  forced  to   push  it  away  ourselves.   Hannah  drilling  from  the  Jewish  press has a follow-up  on  that  question. when   might the Diplomatic  window   closed, what  would prompt   that? We're not going to   speculate on  the closing of   the Diplomatic  window  other  than  to  urge. our  International partners  and  allies  to  try to  find  a  diplomatic  resolution, which  we  strongly  prefer. in   order to  avoid an  entirely   unnecessary war that   unfortunately now hasbulla   and its Iranian warlord  patrons seemed  hell-bent on   dragging  Lebanon into  on   the side of the Hamas Tara   Monsters. Elon  benzion from   AFP asks  you said  the  non-combatant to  combatant  ratio in  this  war is  about  1.5 to  1. Where  are you  getting that  figure? Uh   Elon  if  you accept  the  Hamas figures which we  have   reason  to  doubt but let's  say for the sake  of   argument  we  go  along with   the Hamas figures of  24. uh,  and the IDF figures of   at least  9,000 terrorists   killed  and we  humbly   suggest if  you're  accepting  Hamas figures,  you have  no   reason  to  doubt the figures  coming  from  the IDF.  uh,  then  that  ratio uh  comes  to  around  uh, 1 to 1.5   which is  of course a far cry  from  the global  average of   Civilian  casualties  in   War.  all civilian   casualties. We've repeat  are  a tragedy uh  every single   civilian  casualty  is   too much. and we  repeat  the  unavoidable tragedy that   everyone  who has been   killed  since October 7th.   would still be  alive if   Hamas had not declared  war  and chosen  to  wage  war  from  under and behind   civilian  areas.  and no   1 else  needs to  be  hurt   if  Hamas lays down its arms   and surrenders  as  our  allies  have  been  calling  for question  from  Hannah   lashinski all  Israel news does Israel still  intend  to  take  over  the  Philadelphia  route on the   border  with  Egypt?  Israel   is  in  close contact with   Egypt on  various matters  including continuous   contacts, uh  for the release  of  the hostages  and we're  determined  as  we  said  to   create  the conditions   inside  the Gaza  Strip that   will  ensure  that  it  can  never again be  used  as  a  base  for attacks against  Israel  not like  the death  squads  of  October 7th and  not like  preceding 20  years  of  Rocket  fire  after  persistent  smuggling Okay,  that's  all we have time  for  today.

Sullivan  also  discussed the  continuation  of   humanitarian assistance to   the non-combatant population   in  Gaza. and threats to  the  Israeli people  from  the  North and South from  proxy  forces  of  Iran's  axis  of   Evil. prime minister   Benjamin. Netanyahu also  met  yesterday with  the  president of the  Red Cross,   Marianas  Bali  or it in   their meeting he gave her a  box of  vital medicines for  the hostages  in  Gaza  and  demanded  that the  Red Cross  do  its job and deliver it   to  them. the  Prime Minister told mrs.   Foliage about Hamas is brutal  atrocities  on  10-7  and the  inhumane  conditions. of the   Hamas Terror  dungeons.  the Prime Minister expressed   his gratitude.  for the  Red Cross has  help in securing the  release  of  hostages. and criticize  certain statements  coming   out of  the agency, which  failed  to  make  the  distinction between Hamas is   deliberate  and systematic.  acts of murder. and the  unintended   casualties in this war  which  Hamas started and is  waging   out of urban  areas trying   to  use civilians as  human  Shields.  the Red Cross must   demand. unconditional access   to those  vulnerable   hostages  not subject to  to   be  agreed  with  Hamas as   the Red Cross president.   suggested.  we  condemn  in the  strongest possible   terms in  shameful   statements  by  International  officials trying  to  deflect  blame on to Israel  to  cover  up  the fact  that  they   have  been  covering  up  for  Hamas.  specifically  we   wish to call  out the  Red Cross has Chief legal  officer.  Corps De  le drug.   who falsely claim that   Israel  is  almost  totally  depriving civilians in  Gaza.  of  food  water and medical  supplies. Let's be  clear.   Dr. Draaga  is  not telling  the truth.  Israel  has  excess  capacity  to  inspect  Age trucks  and has placed  0  restrictions  on  the entry  of  humanitarian   associate. He's into  Gaza   the backlog.  Is  that the   rafah crossing  and inside   Gaza  with  un  agencies   unable  to  distribute  Aid  at  the pace  that  Israel   is  inspecting  it  and of   course  with  Hamas stealing   that  Aid sadly the  Red Cross is  doing  everything  to  avoid  admitting that  Hamas steals   Aid and wages war from   inside  hospitals that  must   change. these  statements also,   Really go against the Red  Cross has owned principles of  neutrality  and  confidentiality.  while the  Red Cross openly  criticizes   Israel  a democratic  state  with a  law-abiding.   military  it  is  yet to   utter one.  condemnation  of   Hamas is  systematic   violations  of  international  law.  including its  militarization  of the  very   hospitals that  the Red Cross  funds and works at  how  could they  not know? and now  that  they  do  now,  why do   they  not speak out?  It's   not particularly  difficult.   finally her Stark reminder of  Moss is threat to Global   Security. yesterday  security agencies in   Denmark.  for today terror   attack  that  would have   killed  innocent  civilians  on  European  soil.  arresting.   seven terrorists acting on   behalf  of  Hamas.  since  10-7. Hamas has been   stepping  up  its attempts   to  expand  its attacks  against Israelis  Jews  and  other Western targets around   the world.  Israel   is fighting on the  front  lines of  humanity. and Hamas  is  coming  for you.  too.   the West  next  the same   monsters  who intentionally  and methodically  burned  the  headed  and raped Israelis   on  10-7  would gladly   globalize their intifada  as   protesters  on  campuses  and  streets around  the West   are calling for they  aim to   sow Terror  on  the streets  of  Western capitals. and the  whole world must  be   vigilant. and stand in   solidarity  with  us  as  we   battle  our common  enemy,   which wants all of  us. a lot  which wants all of  us. are  like  dead. that's   come to the end of  today's  update will now take  your   questions through the chat,  please. Let's questions from   Adam  Scott velocity  Israel   Innovation fund.  It  seems  like  more  Daylight  is   being seen  between the  United States and Israel.  when it comes to  this  war.   and now recently  President  Biden stated  that  we  have   been  in discriminately  bombing Gaza  and CNN just   released  the report.  that almost 40% of our  bombs  are on  guided. quoting many   people  who criticize this   tactic  as  well.  There's the prime.   his office  have any comment.  about these unguided  bombs.   or  the recent  remarks?   coming  out of  the White  House related to  this.  Thank you Adam  for your   questions.  as   for your first  question   about the timing of this  war  Israel  and the United   states  are fully aligned on   a mission to  destroy it   Hamas.  the only  clock that   matters.  Is that every  second  that  Hamas still  exist after ten seven.  It is  a ticking time bomb and the  best  way for our allies  to   expedite  an  end to this  war.  which Hamas started  is to and by us as  we  push   for total victory over  Hamas  the destruction of  Hamas  using Swift decisive  and  overwhelming. but intense  fighting  in  weeks not  months. this  is  Rob believe  that  bison it did provide   Administration  is  imposing.  a political calendar. on  the  wall  because of  the  upcoming  US   presidential election.   Joel as I said  in response  to  the previous  question   Israel  and the United   states  are fully aligned  on the  mission to  destroy  Hamas that  has been   consistent  since 10-7 the   only  clock that  matters Is   that  every second  Hamas  still exists  after  ten seven.  It  is  a ticking  time bomb that  we  must   diffuse it will explode.   In our  faces again and the  best way  for our allies   to expedite an end to this   war which Hamas  started and we  also want to   see over but  needs to be  over  with  the end of  Hamas  is  to stand  by  us  as  we   push  for total victory over   hummus the  total Destruction  of  Hamas using Swift  decisive. and overwhelming   force in  the face  of  what   the United  States  has  defined as  pure. evil.  question from Jim Williams   anger and news service,  Washington  d.c.  Does  the  internet? does  the  International?  does  the  Israeli government  the the  view? of  the US  that   Israel  is  clearly winning  the war against a mask  but  is  and the  USA as the US did in   Afghanistan.  losing  the  messaging war on  the world  stage.  by  how we  are.   Israel is fighting  the war  in  Gaza  and how it's  being  reported. First of all   Israel  is  clearly winning  the war.  right now under the  direction of  prime minister   Netanyahu and the war cabinet  we  are making  major.   achievements towards   achieving.   in the goals of this  war  we have already.   significantly degraded  Hamas  has capabilities  inside   Gaza. We  see that  with the   dramatic  drop  in  rocket   fire. towards Israel. We see   that  with the  destruction  of  their military  assets.  We  see that  with  the  must surrender  of  Hamas  terrorists  just  yesterday  70  emerging  from  the  camel. Add  one.   Hospital in Northern  Gaza.  We've made  large strides  towards the other goal of the  war of  bringing  back  the  hostages  with  110 coming   back  to  Israel  not enough   we  still need  to  bring  back  the other 132 and  are committed to  to that  pledge  of  no one  left   behind  and our job is  to   remind the  world of  exactly  what  it  knew on.  10-7  as   news  began to  emerge  of   the act of  burning beheading  and rape  during  Hamas is   systematic  extermination.   of  Israeli civilians as   former  President Obama said   on  the morning of  10 7  as   the news  was just  beginning  to  come  out the United   States  in the  world must   stand firmly  by  Israel  as   it. dismantles  Hamas.  They   know  that  to be true   They've known that  to be  true  since 10-7. They  know   it  to be true, too.   Hamas is  best  efforts  to generate.  diplomatic   pressure. through creating   International.  Sympathy by  deliberately. manufacturing a  humanitarian  crisis  in   Gaza. and we're going to   continue  shining  a spotlight.  on  Hamas is   crimes  against humanity, and  its war crimes  and on our   unprecedented efforts to try   to  keep  civilians on the   other side  safe  as we  prosecute.  what  is   probably  the quintessential   example of  a just  War.   in the  21st century  We  did  not start this  war we   did not want  this   war. We did not expect. fact   this  war  I must declare this war.   against us  and we will  continue  with  our defensive  campaign  until we  achieve.   total victory.  question   from  Jung. KO  has made up  the skin. from  kyodo news.  regarding the hostages  and  missing persons.  missing  persons families Forum   notice  that  shock among the  families  of  the hostages   at the  rejection of  the  direct  at the  rejection of   the director of the muscles  proposal. travel  to Qatar   to  forming a new hostage.   deal  do you  have  any  comment on  this? we  have   no  comment on.  negotiation surrounding the  return of the hostages.  You'll appreciate this  is  a  sensitive.  situation and  human lives.  Hang in the  balance and the lest we say  the better. but we   reaffirm the  state of   Israel  is  doing everything   it can. in  order to  bring  those hostages  home. safe   and sound.  immediately and  unconditionally.  to  ensure   they have access  to  the  Red Cross which is  not been   doing enough  to  secure   access. to  those hostages.  and we  will  consider  and  continue with Avenue  in   order to get  those hostages   home, you know   one thing maybe people  don't  realize around the  world  Israel  is  such  a small  country that  this is a very   personal  issue.  for all of   us. 250 hostages  in a   country of  10  million  people  means that  everyone   knows at least  someone who  has had someone's stolen   from  them. and we  repeat   our pledge. that we will   leave.  No one  left  behind.  and that  none of us  are  free  to all  of  them  are  free  and that's  why like so  many  Israelis  I have   around  my  own neck  this   dog tag in  Authority with   the hostages  that  says  on   it  bring them  home  now and  in  Hebrew  her live,  so long she avoided as   our our hearts  are still  trapped in  Gaza. Thank you  very much.  Okay. Thank you  very  much. Everyone. Have a   safe  weekend.  Keep  safe.

Thank you so  much  as   always  towel for taking the   time  to  be  here  with  us.  Thank you, Josh.  First off.   I do  want  to  talk   a little  bit about what   happened  there on  New  Year's  as  the clock did  strike  midnight  there and  Israel. There was a barrage  of  rockets that  was fired  by  Hamas.  What  can you  tell  me  about that? as   you guys  are trying  to   celebrate the new year you   have. Rockets coming  in   your  direction.  I saw  I'd personally  with my own  eyes. I was based in   Tel Aviv. at  midnight  and  exactly.  when the  clock  hits midnight so misfired.   dozens  of  missiles  towards  South and Central Israel. and  there you have  it  instead  of  having. fireworks  and celebrations  in  the  skies listening to  people,  you know, cheering  @midnight  You see these very  said   images  in  the skies of   interceptions Thankfully  we   have the  Iron Dome.  but  it's  it's  Trade just   we have gotten  used to  living. under such  a reality  for.  all the years in which   Hamas has been  in  power.   in  Gaza, and we  say no   more. you know  that since   the beginning of  the war  that Hamas  has dragged us   into  on  October 7th more   than  13,000   thousand Rockets   thirteen thousand Rockets  Josh  were  fired towards  Israeli territory.  This  is   not a reality that  we  will   agree to  this  is  why we're  operating in  Gaza  right  now,  So  we  wanted  a  different.  for the new year,  but I can tell  you that  for  many  of  us. It's  still  October 7th.  2023. because  we  still have  129 hostages   being held  captive.  by   a brutal  terrorist.   organizations  for 80-plus days  in  Gaza   and it feels  as if time  is   standing  still.  for many   of us.  all of us,  I think  we  can say so  you know  the  the custom of course  is  to   is to take  upon  oneself.   resolutions  make new decisions. Visions  for the coming  year  usually  individuals make it but I  can tell  you that  in   Israel. We  are making  these  decisions.  for the new year   as  a nation  and we  are  very  United. and  the resolve is  clear.  We   will. destroy Hamas. We will   eliminate their terrorist  regime. we  will  bring back.  all of  the hostages  home.  Nobody  will  be left behind.  and Gaza  will  never posed a  terror threat to us again.   Now we  have  seen  video of   a Hamas operative being  interviewed it was   Easter short time ago and  he did  say that  Hamas  does in fact  use Gaza   civilians as  human Shields.   which is  something that   you've  mentioned when   I've spoken to  you other  Israeli.  government.  spokespersons have  mentioned  that  as  well. Do  you hope   the public  is going  to   listen  to that message and  maybe watch that  video and  understand  the dangers that   are opposed to  Gaza   civilians by  Hamas.  We   always  hope Josh that  more   and more  people  around  the  world will  understand  what   we're dealing with. We  have   said  it  all along.  not  only  now also  in  previous   rounds  of  conflict  with   Hamas.  This  is  what  they   do. That's  their strategy.  they  are committing  a  double  War crime when  they   target  our civilian   population  from  inside  and  underneath  their own  civilian  population, and  they  admitted they in   interrogations  Hamas  commanders  that  we  have   interrogated here.  in   Israel, they  say it  on   record  we  have  shown  video proof of  the strategy   and unfortunately you have   many  in the  international.   Community.  overlooking this   very  set aspect  and then   you have  some  who  definitely  many  brother who  definitely  acknowledge the  commissar doing this  using  the Palestinian civilians as   human Shields.  but then   they  put the pressure  on   Israel  but Israel  operates   against these terrorists  and  that  is  that  is   outrageous  because they  are  in fact incentivizing this   use of  human Shields if   you put the pressure on  Israel  if  you want   Israel to take  the fire  for  Hamas is  actions.  Well  you  are just  blowing wind  in   their sails so  to say  we've  also  seen  some  of  the  images  that  have been  posted  by  the IDF as  well   as  the Israel  Twitter page   a lot of  different  organizations.  tweeting  out  these photos  and videos   that  show  more  weapons of   now been found  inside  been   school  classrooms  including  kindergartens, right? Yes,   and we  found.  me   teeny tiny. Hamas.  uniform  tailored for  children.  photos  of  children  women  with  weapons.  In  fact  we   have  released  also  the IDF  released a video of one Hamas  Commander another  a different one who was  interrogated  in  Israel,  and he  admitted  that  they   are exploiting  children   using children  to  transfer.  ammunition. Who does  that   what  kind of monsters  are  using?  children  for their  War Machine?  This  is  what   Israel is dealing.  with   these types of  terrorists   that  is  outrageous  and  to that I ask Will words   UNICEF  whereas UNICEF  We   actually  heard an  account  of  first-hand  account now  for me  a Shem. She's the  young woman who was shot   taken hostage by  Hamas.  and  we  did see the first  propaganda  video that  was  released  by  Hamas showed   her and she kind of  talked about  that  video.   in  about a 30-minute  interview.  What  do you   hope  that  people  are  going to  take  away  from   her story specifically  first  I watched the interviews   with  me. both  Mia and her  family  her mother. are.   so courageous so  resilient  and I think that people out  there have  to  understand.  that  this  is  exactly what   the Israel  Israeli nation   is  feeling right now.  Yes,   we  have  been  through  a terrible. He'll try.  on   October 7th, but  we will  prevail and Mia is  a  tremendous  example.  of   this  but Mia actually   appeared  in  to  propaganda   videos  the first one  wouldn't  she was being held   captive by  some  moss and if  you remember  you saw in that  video how they  were.  treating  her her arm because  she was injured a vet  actually. operated  her as   she described.  in  her  account to  want to be   Israeli channels  and it  was  pure propaganda.  De because   in  that  video is  she said   that  they're treating  me   well. but when  you listen   to  the interview  she's describing  the hell.  she is  been  through how she  was traumatized.  how she was  watched 24/7  by  a terrorist  and his family  by  way.   how she was starved how she  wasn't  even  she had to   change  her own.  her own.   medical equipment that  the  Band-Aids and so  today.  and  she's been through  hell. but  like  Mia?  kept  optimistic   and knew  that  she will.  make  her way out and  prevail.  we  have   a moral duty  to  Mia.   by the  way,  to  promise her  that  she can be  completely   safe  now when  she's in   Israel  that  the terrorists   will  never ever  get to her   again.  and to  the ones  who  were  for now left  behind.  We will bring each  and every  one of  them  home  for that   reason  we  will  continue   with  the operation  will continue with the  war  that  we  were  dragged into.  We will eliminate this   terrorist rating. and we've  seen  a lot of   pro-palestinian or  I really   should  say.  anti-israel.   protests that have  been   taking  place here. across   the u.s.  They've been   across  the world.  What   do you  say to  folks right  now?  who are taking  part   in  those?  protests? I know   that  we  talked about  one,   right before  we  brought you  on. over  at  JFK airport  in New  York, and there was  one on  Wall  Street  the  same  group responsible for  both, but what  do  you say  to  those?   protesters? Who are out there  that  this  is  a time  for  moral duty. It's  not just me  saying  it  the  Prime Minister said at   President Biden said  it   many  other world leaders  who?  came  here  to  stand  with  Israel  in  Israel.  throughout  the war have   said  it  it's  a time  for  moral clarity.  It  is  very   important that  we  the  international Community not  only  Israel. We just  happened  to  be  on the   front lines of the  war.   against terrorism right now.   Send an unequivocal message  against terrorism the year   is  2020 for  Josh   terrorism.  Is  a dead  end  and everyone  around   the world must  understand   the terrorism is  a dead   end.  So  we  are sending a  clear message.  not only  to   Hamas but to  every bad  actor.  around  the world  right now Don't try us  don't  test  us  and these people   who are protesting. against  Israel  simply. don't don't  get it. They don't  get it.  and I think they  have  to   do  some  some  some   learning they have to better   understand what really   happened here.  and  you know what?  They're not  really  helping the  Palestinian civilians.  Maybe  they  think they are  but  they're not what  they're  doing is  serving as   apologist for Hamas because  if  you're not  standing  for  Israel  right now.  well   you're you're helping Hamas.   and Israel  does  say that   it  Hamas.   and Israel does say that it  is  going to  remove  some   of  the troops  there that   have  been  on the  ground.  They are  in  Gaza. What   does that say about the war  itself  is  that  saying   that  things  are winding  down  the fight against Hamas  has is  ending  anytime soon.  No, not at all. We  have   very  clear.  goals.  for  this  war.  We  said  Hamas  will  be  eliminated  Gaza   will  be  demilitarized and  we  hope  that  the  Palestinian Society  afterwards  will be the  radicalized.  we  also   want to make  sure  that  we   won't see a Resurgence  of   course  of  terrorism in the   Gaza  Strip and the Gaza   will  never ever  posed a  terror threat to  Israel   again now.  this  will  take   time. This  will  take  time   and for that  we are  making   certain.  adjustments.  with   the troops  on  the ground   the forces  on  the ground,  but this  is  something very   very  natural just  there a  reshuffling.  of the  forces.  some  respite.  some  rest.  to  some of the troops, but  it  says  nothing about the  bigger  picture.  my last  question  here. What  can  you tell  me  about the next   possible? deal  for?   another?  hostage release  Here  Is  there anything   in the  works?  Are we  far  along in  that  What  can you  actually  tell  me  right  now?  now?  that  the  hostages  plate is   definitely  the top of  mind   every day every minute  every  hour  they  have  been   through horrendous. things.  That's what we're hearing  from  the ones who  were   released  and we  will   continue  to  pursue  every  Avenue  to  bring about  the release of  all hostages.  Now we  know  that  what has   created.  what  created the  conditions  that  can  November  to  bring about the  release of  hostages  the  ones who  came  back  so  far  as  pair of this  outline,   that  was mediated  by   International actors  was the  pressure that we  exerted on   Hamas.  in  the war on  the  ground  we  will  continue   to  hit them  hard  and we   hope  that this will   once again  create  the right  conditions  to  see the  release of  more  hostages   We  will  not stop  and  we will not rest  We  will   bring them  home. All right  tell  Heinrich  they are   Israeli government   spokesperson. Thank you so   much  as  always  for  taking the  time  to join us   and help  break down  the  latest. developments  here   in  the war.  Is  there  anything  else  you want to  add Before? I Let You Go. I  would like  to. say happy  2024  a safe  and secure   one to all of your viewers.  All right.  Thank you again  for taking  the time  to  be   here  with  us.

It's including  140 since  Hamas resumed hostilities on   December  1st when  it   terminated  the hostage  released  pause.  those  numbers.  include Hamas  terrorists  who have  been   surrendering  to  our forces   as  their morale  crumbles.  as  IDF chief-of-staff.  Hosea Levi said yesterday  that very bold. situation  assessment  with  the head   of the  Shin  Bet.  in  the  heart of  Khan.

We  call  on  all  Hamas  Hamas terrorists to sir.   surrender and we  call   on the  whole International  Community.  to  demand   that the  October 7th  monsters  hand  themselves   over  to  face  Justice.   immediately and  unconditionally.  that simply  the ABC of  International  Peace and security. the more   Hamas terrorists  surrender  the fewer we  will have to   eliminate and the quicker  they  surrounded  the more   intelligence  we  will  have   to  bring this  war to  a  decisive  end.  this  morning  Israel  opened  the  kerem Shalom  Crossing   for the inspection  of   humanitarian Aid  trucks  for  Gaza. the nitsana Crossing.  Has excess capacity?  to   inspect Age trucks  and now  we  have  added excess excess  capacity? enough  to  double   the provision of  Aid to   civilians in  Gaza. today We   screen the first  batch of   Age trucks  for possible   Hamas weapon smuggling  at   kerim Shah long before  they   drove to the  rafah Crossing.  and from  there handed over  to  Aid agencies  in  Gaza.  We  repeat  there are no   restrictions  on  Israel's   part  to the  entry of   humanitarian  Necessities  into Gaza The problem is the   bottleneck  the Crossing with  Egypt and the problem is that  Israel  is  currently  inspecting  Aid quicker than   un  agencies  on  the ground   are able  to  deliver it   Israel  is  constantly   monitoring  the humanitarian   situation.  making  sure   there are areas in which   civilians can have  access   to  Aid and we're going above  and beyond  our obligations  under humanitarian  law to   facilitate  the provision.   of  that  Aid to   enemy control territory all  the while Hamas.  hijacks the  aid for itself  when I  hope   of  course  you've  been   covering  those dramatic   images  of  Hamas.   hijacking a truck.  X inside   the Gaza  Strip an update  from  the northern  border   has Bala continues  its  aggression. towards Israeli  towns and cities  and we  are  of  course. retaliating.   accordingly.  We  repeat   Israel  is  not insisted  is   not interested  in  a  two-front war.  but if   Hezbollah chooses to  drag us  into  a full-scale  war the  state of  Lebanon will   pay a very  heavy price.  for  any armed attacks emanating.   from  its soil. that   brings us to the end  of   today's update  will   now take  your questions   if you  could write  write them in the chat.  And as always we encourage   you to send those questions  in  in advance so we can   check all the necessary facts  and figures you need   with the  relevant   authorities.   the first question from Jody   Cohen from  world is  One  news  in  India.  following  reports that  Israeli  officials are working with   Cyprus. to  inspect Aid  deliveries  Cyprus  to  Gaza   from  Cyprus  Will  this  be   replicated? with  other  countries?  in  order?  for  more  a to  be  delivered  to the  people  of  Gaza? And  what  is  being done  to   ensure  that  Hamas isn't  stealing  Aid as  Miz has  been  reported. Thanks for   your  question  Jody. Let me   repeat. what  I just  said   there is  no  problem at  the  moment  in terms  of  the  inspection  of  Aid trucks.  That  is  not responsible  in any  way.  for the  bottleneck  of  getting  Aid in to God.  Aza there is   already.  excess capacity at   nitsana the latest  figures  from  kogut suggest they   have  an ability  to  inspect  up  to  250 trucks   that need sauna and with  the  opening of  kerem Shalom  now  we  will  have  the ability  to  double  that  if  the  agencies  on  the ground  are  able  to  deliver that  Aid  the problem is  the  bottleneck  up  the rough ER   Crossing  and the fact that  the aid agencies  on  the  ground  in  Gaza  are not  able  to  deliver the  humanitarian  Aid at the   pace  that  Israel  is  able   to  screen  it  and we are   of course.  above and beyond   our obligations under  International humanitarian   law to  facilitate the   provision.  of  life-saving  humanitarian. Aid to   civilians even  in  territory  controlled  by  an  enemy  that  continues to  bombard  our continues to  bombard our  cities  with  the rockets and  to  continue to talk  at us  with the  tax and we  are  using those inspections at   both  nitsana and  kerem Shalom  both  of  which  have  excess capacity.  in   order to  make  sure  that   Hamas isn't able  to  exploit  community's Goodwill   in order to smuggle weapons  into  the Gaza Strip and  we   expect the  whole  International Community to   firmly  insist. and to   condemned Hamas and call  it   out when  it  is  found.   stealing. humanitarian  Aid  inside  Gaza, and I hope   you've seen those images  of   the civilians in  Gaza   having  AIDS  stolen  from   them. by  Hamas and is   outrageous  really  frankly  outrageous  that  the  international agencies  on   the ground  that  supposedly   feigned the most  interest   for civilians inside  Gaza.  Have absolutely nothing to   say.  when  the Hamas Terror   regime. steals  that   Aid in order to keep  its own  fighters  Well fed well  stocked and as  the Hamas  Terror regime crumbles  were   already beginning to  see  people  in  Gaza  speaking   more  freely  against the  Hamas regime  and explaining   pouring out their anger.   and their frustration.  and  explaining  how they  see  Hamas and your case in   Juarez  squirrely responsible  for the Calamity  that  has  befallen  them. question   from  Talia mintzberg,  New  York, New York  Times How  does  Israel  see the Hootie   threat? and what steps  will   Israel  take  to  counter it?  tie a question about  the  houthi  throat, you know  the  the slogan  of  the houthis.   Wikipedia this  check this   off to us because it's   difficult to  believe their  slogan is Allahu Akbar? death  to  America?  death to   Israel. accursed be the Jews.  I'm not making  this up.   Victory to  Islam The houthis  are an  Iranian proxies  that call for death and  destruction with the   self-awareness  of  cartoon  villains  their  Maritime attacks  are a clear  threat  not only  to  Israel,  but also  to  International  Peace and security. to   International.  trade.  that   threat  will  be  addressed  and we  think that  this  is   an  important wake-up call   an  important reminder  for  the whole International  Community.  about the threat   that  Iranian aggression.  policies not only to  the  state of  Israel. not only   to  our Arab Neighbors  but  the whole structure of   international trade and  International Peace and  security  question  from  Jim  Williams  of  zinc zinc or   international news  service,   Washington  d.c.  The US   Congress  is  likely  not.   to pass a to  Israel  until  January.  will  this  delay  in  any way?  any way hurt   the Israeli war effort? so   far the United  States  has  been  standing  shoulder to  shoulder  with  us  with   very  clear moral.  military   and diplomatic  support as   well. and we  welcome as well  as  we  said  those remarks  from  president.  Biden just   yesterday at  the Hanukkah.  ceremony at the White House  saying  that the  United   States  is  going to   continue  to  provide  military  assistance  to   Israel  until we  win we   gratefully  welcome that   support from  our allies   in the  United  States. who  understand that the  destruction.  of  Hamas is   not only  a national   interest  security  interest   for us, but our  national security  interest for the  United.  States  the whole of the   West  and indeed  the whole  of  humanity  and we   thank them  with   a great deal of gratitude for  that  support.  question   from  Joe public  at   Breitbart News  What  are the  prospects of  seeing  a  hostage rescue? Israel? Will   of course do  everything   possible  to  get?  all the  hostages  home  our declared   mission is  there will be no   one left  behind. and we   will  do  everything  we   can.  to  get not only  the  women but the men The Young  and the old the civilians  and the soldiers  there  will be no  one left  behind   our strategy  is  to   continue  putting.   unrelenting military   pressure  on  Hamas until it   begs  for a breather   and is willing to release  those hostages. We've already  seen  that  strategy.  Vindicated  with  the hostage  release spores, I think 110  hostages  released  over   that  time. that strategy has  proven. itself. that strategy  adopted by  the war cabinet  and we're continuing  with   it  now.  wherever  it  is   possible. to  swoop in  with   special forces  and rescue   hostages. We  will  of course  try to  do  that, but I'll   draw  your  attention to  an   incident  just  last  week. I  think it  was on. Thursday   night when  we  tried to.  rescue  hostages. in  a  mission That  was  unsuccessful  and led to   serious injuries  to two  IDF  soldiers  who had to  be   cleared.  for medical  treatment.  Unfortunately  Hamas has spent a very  long   time. planning  and plotting.  to  abduct  our hostages.  they've prepared  for this   moment. They're not holding  them  in  a big Airport  arrivals Hall like  in   entebbe where we   can just swoop. Ooh pin and  pick  them  up, but wherever   an  option  exists. for.   to rescue the hostages  and  get them  out.  We  will   do that and besides that   were  continuing  with the   strategy of unrelenting.   military  pressure  on  Hamas  to  get it  to  release all  of the  hostages. None of us   are free  to all  of  them   are free. a further question   from  Joel  Pollock.  which  is  what  is   Israel's response to  the  decision  of  Harvard  University. not to  dismiss  dismiss,  its president.   despite.  condoning.   extreme anti-abortion.   Israel and  anti-semitic   rhetoric  We're not getting  into  internal  politics   in the  Harvard Board of   Governors,  but it's   important.  to  put for the  record  There must  be   zero tolerance. for  anti-semitism.  There must be  zero tolerance. for calls for  violence. against Israelis   and Jews. calls to  globalize  the intifada  or  wage and   intifada  are calls for  targeted  violence. against  Jews  and Israelis. around   the world.  We know what  the  intifada  is  It  was  a wave of brutal  suicide  bombings  inside   Israel in the the early 2000s  that  over the  space of   four  years murdered  as   many  people  as  in  the  October 7th Massacre  itself   and they  must  be   zero tolerance. for genocide   all calls for intifada  or   for from  the river to the   Sea.  which would leave  no space  for the state of   Israel  calling for the  destruction of the  state of   Israel  and must  be   zero tolerance  for  anti-Semitism.  and for the  various manifestations  that   tragically  we're seeing  on   University  campuses.  the final question  from  Jim  Williams  from  Zenga.   follow-up the US are  What   is  going on  on the   northern border?  President  Biden and his team  have   said  that  if  things   pick up the US  will  support  Israel  with  the military   needed. do  you think it   will  help  calm  things   down  on  the Northern   front?  We are  of  course   trying  to  contain the  situation.  stop the  war.   in  Gaza  from  escalating   and spreading to  additional   fronts  as  Hamas has  persistently  been  trying   to  do  since the first  moment  of  October 7th Our  strategy is the destruction  of  Hamas in  Gaza. and firm.  against Hezbollah in the   north.  That's why  we   have the largest  ever  call   up  of  reserves. That's  why  we  are responding.  forcefully  to  aggression   on  the Northern  front and  in  that  context.  We  also   welcome the two American   aircraft  battle  carrier  groups  that have come   to the  Middle East in  order  to  send  a very  clear  message.  to  Hezbollah and  anyone  else  thinking  of   entering  this  war in the   words of  our friend.  President Biden.  don't  question  from  Dan Williams   of  Reuters is  Israel  now  requiring that  its cargo  ships make  the trip  from   Asia  around. Africa.  rather than through the  Red Sea and sewers  do to  Hootie  threats If  so,  do you  have  an  estimate   of  the expected? price high   price hike  for imported   goods?  Then I  don't  have the  information at hand  to  answer  your  question.

"The Hill", "transcript": "[Music] I'm sure you all remember the explosive New York Times article from the end of last year called how Hamas weaponized sexual violence on October 7th we have a big update now on that story The New York Times has pulled an episode of its podcast the daily about sexual violence from the October 7th attack on Israel as debates from inside the paper about reporting on the subject heat up per The Intercept the daily episode had been scheduled for January 9th and was based on that article from Pulitzer Prize winner Jeffrey Gelman claiming Hamas had quote systematically used sexual violence as a weapon of War originally gelman's article was praised in the New York Times halls but criticism of the pce began to grow internally and externally leading the daily producers to pause the episode joining us now to weighin is editor at the gry zone max Blumenthal who's been following this very closely and doing much of the firsthand reporting uh on the original episode and trying to substantiate some of the claims that were made therein welcome back max good to be back and thanks for hosting me at a more politically difficult difficult time to take some of these bogus claims down well it is it's a difficult time as you mentioned but because a lot of the ground work that you and Aon and Folks At The gry Zone uh have done in electric in inata have done on this there is more space now to talk about it apparently so much so that this is being discussed and debated within the New York Times so tell us what is the source of the controversy we we're the source of the controversy I mean they call us critics in the New York Times now but everybody and their mother and their mother's baby daddy and the baby's Mo knows that we are responsible for causing this crisis at the New York Times where New York Times internally is having a freak out over Jeffrey Gelman and his team's alleged like I call it alleged reporting because I don't even know how much reporting they did accusing Hamas of using rape as a systematic weapon on October 7th in order to validate the Israeli government's genocidal Rampage through the Gaza strip um and we just had been breaking it down for weeks and weeks and weeks and then apparently the New York Times wanted to go ahead with this daily kind of video episode in which they were going to report systematic rape as a weapon on October 7th as a fact without including any of the criticism but other times staffers basically the times Rank and file the journalists were not having it and they according to reporting from The Intercept which also doesn't credit us just refers to us as critics which is kind of funny because the intercept also validated a lot of these lies uh that we've been debunking um they revealed that it was the New York Times higher-ups that were holding on to gelman's reportings reporting because of their own ideological proclivities um that for example Joel Khan and a New York Times board member had ties to the Israel lobby but the journalists weren't having it the facts weren't there we had debunked many of the witnesses and then family members of the witnesses as I'll explain came out and basically denied gelman's reporting so there was a new article from The New York Times yesterday un to study reports of sexual violence in Israel during October 7th attack that does repeat um several of the uh of the accusations makes a note of of some of the testimony from these various people uh seir being the first name of one of the uh alleged eyewitnesses um some other information from survivors and First Responders Etc this article does I I think a better job of um acknowledging some as you said one person disputing how they were characterized initially by the times and some other matters I guess my question is is your argument here now over the use of the word I guess systemic um because I think as you conceded in our last interview it is perfectly plausible that there was sexual assault taking place but that there was something um a little beyond that alleged in the initial article that it was directed or or so widespread or something like that I mean I'm just going off the evidence and there is evidence that Hamas militants killed non-combatants on October 7th shot them killed them With Grenades there's there's video evidence of that right now there is no evidence of any rape taking place that doesn't mean I'm going to just deny it but the but the claims put forward in this New York Times article the claims put forward in the guardian the claims put for put forward by NBC those are what we've been debunking they don't add up and so when you talk about this witness superar who is the Israeli police's key witness and the Israeli police have in an interview with haritz that that witness that there is no physical or forensic evidence or video evidence or any evidence to back up any of her claims when this witness claims to have W been shot in the back then witnessed uh gang rape and then Hamas militants whipping out three decapitated heads of women and this person can't be fully identified you have to start questioning some of these claims I mean it sounds like something out of Texas Chainsaw Massacre we've seen so many lies the lies about 40 beheaded babies the lie about the um pregnant woman's fetus being cut out and all of these lies boiling down to some of the same sources like the so-called rescue organization zaka which as we now know from a haret investigation was bankrupt on the day of October 7th and is now flushed with millions of dollars because of the tall tales and led story that spun out on October 7th you have to start to question them and so we put forward these questions and showed inconsistencies and testimony by witness after witness including zaka who Jeffrey Gelman in the New York Times relied on and so what Jeffrey Gelman did is he went back to these witnesses to try to get them to validate his initial reporting and they couldn't do it seir changed her story again Raz Cohen another key witness refused to speak to him on the grounds that he was traumatized and the worst and sleaziest thing that Jeffrey Gelman did is he went to a woman named mural alter who is the sister of one of the key Witnesses exhibit a her name is gal Abdus the woman in the black dress who is found killed with burns on her head and gettelman just assumed based on the video that she had been raped by Hamas her own sister had come out and said there was no way she could have been raped said this on Instagram that the New York Times manipulated them into thinking that the story would be about something else her brother-in-law said the same thing in a separate interview with Israeli media and so gettman calls up the sister mural alter and apparently tries to pressure her into backing down in order to save his own journalistic reputation so this piece that you mentioned Robbie is one of the sleaziest exercises in damage control it doesn't disprove anything by the so-called critics referring to us and other independent Publications like electronic and defat and mondo Weiss or what Briana has said here uh and I think the Scandal continues let let me let me raise one other point so in in terms of the video evidence so I I've seen the the video footage um as well and what I can recall seeing that would perhaps support what is being reported or being described by several of these witnesses that you've described the issues you have with them um is the some of the female bodies found in States of undress also found with I can recall vividly um H bound hand wrists tied together that sort of thing um what do you make of that well we have uh um Sergeant G who uh I've actually uh identified on Twitter a lot of these Israeli Special Forces figures Pilots operate under uh you kind of hidden identities largely for fear of being prosecuted for war crimes this guy is uh in special Rescue Unit 669 of the Air Force and he claimed to the New York Times as he did previously to I believe haritz and several other Publications that he found two young women in kibuts bery who were teenagers in a state of undress with seamen on their back the problem is there were no women found that way are official records of how everyone was found and there were there no there was no record the only PE teenagers or young girls whose ages match those of the ones described by Sergeant G were the shirabi sisters who were 13 and 16 and they were found uh in a state burned so badly that they could only be identified by their teeth and their DNA and they were found with their mother directly with them so he lied this is someone who previously lied because I've been able to unmask him he previously lied about find founding a baby be thrown in a garbage can and this speaks to another massive Scandal about October 7th that's finally been coming to the surface that Israeli media has been reporting on but we were out in front of it and it's it's a scandal that continues to this day the use of the Hannibal directive the only way that these girls and their mother would have been found or the most plausible way in a home that had collapsed on them in such a badly burned state is that they were hit by a t shell or a Hellfire missile fired by an Israeli tank or helicopter and this happened repeatedly in kibuts Berry it's been documented at least we we we've documented and confirmed that at least 16 Israeli civilians were killed in one home with us two tank shell strikes and this was done in order to kill the captives and the Hamas militants to prevent Hamas from having the political leverage they now enjoy with having over 200 captives and it continues now in the Gaza strip uh a cousin of a hostage in the Gaza Strip her name is Naomi Dan Dan has gone on Israel's National broadcaster con news and accused the Israeli government of enacting the Hannibal directive to kill the Israeli captives there to prevent a prisoner swap she said you're killing our families instead of cutting the deal and having the ceasefire we need so we've been exposing these scandals from the beginning and now mainstream Israeli media is beginning to accept that we were actually on to something we're not just a bunch of conspiracists and it's only a matter of time before us media is going to have to do this as well but they're they're resisting because of the higher-ups at places like the New York Times who are ideologically committed to seeing Israel quote unquote win yeah I did watch that uh uh news interview that you just described with the uh hostage members uh family member and it was really compelling it is a remarkable contrast between the kind of coverage and stories that are aired even on Israeli TV which you would think would might be more ideologically opposed to airing that kind of content as opposed to an American uh and the American Media so just to to wrap up here the the posture of this is that the New York Times usually often frequently put out a podcast daily podcast episode that covers some of its more important reporting and so you'll read it in the New York Times and then a day or two later you'll hear about it in your morning as you're getting dressed listening to the Daily in this case the difference between the coverage that in the in the daily after there was this critique from the staffers was going to be so significant from the coverage of the original reporting that raised some questions about the credibility of the new reporting and whether or not Corrections were due you also alluded to a story in the guardian that's also gotten some push back there was a corroborating a very similar um story alleging a WID spread sexual abuse on October 7th there and now there are some additional uh not just questions about the substance of that reporting but also plagiarism claims associated with it yeah I Brianna we're looking at one of the biggest media scandals of our time were basically one journalist after another at August enlightened liberal Publications were led into publishing one fabrication after another by a government that had curated witnesses to present a story in order to justify genocide I mean it's unbelievable so you have the scandal of the caliphate at the New York Times ruk Mei kalamaki this self-styled National Security reporter and Isis expert was basically led into a journalistic disaster by relying on one supposedly former supposedly former Isis member who turned out to be a fraud and she did this very popular podcast and he made the whole thing up here you have a collection of witnesses who are spinning out frauds for not just one jour journalists but journalists across the media and it appears if you look at the plagiarism in the guardian by uh bethan mckernin who blocked me as soon as I pointed it out her plagiarism from NBC news that they're both not copying each other They're copying the Israeli government which seems to have furnished them a document and they just sloppily cut copy and pasted the same document about uh witness testimony into their peace and it's testimony that turns out to be bogus then you have Jeffrey Gelman who relied on the same witness I mean they're all relying on the same Witnesses who are furnished to them by the Israeli government which is just known for its lies its deceit its criminality and now they're caught Jeffrey Gelman previously was caught in Zimbabwe fabricating a quote by then leader Robert Mugabe and it looks like he blamed an anonymous local journalist leading the police on a Manhunt for an anonymous journalist but he had to acknowledge that he made up the quote so there's a long history here but when you make up stories about official enemies who are hated like Robert mugabi where you know Zimbabwe has faced sanctions for years by the former British colonists in the US and he's portrayed as this Evil dark dictator or when you make up stories about Hamas nobody's supposed to care you're allowed to lie because of the uh the the the Insidious racism that still pervades liberal culture and when the LIE is about H Savage Arab Barbarian males coming in and raping Jewish women at a music festival well that falls on fertile soil even among liberals uh but we could tell at the gry zone and at other independent Publications that these were not the the these stories didn't add up and that these were lies that killed because these lies and these Fabrications and distortions of Hal truths and exaggerations of facts on October 7th are designed to generate political consent for Israel's genocidal assault in Gaza so they need to be called out and we're going to continue to do it Max thank you for all of your independent journalism and before we go I just want to say you know we get um we get a response when you're on this is a show that features robust debate so gettleman or anyone else involved in reporting on story is welcome on our show the uh pro-israel expert voices are welcome on our show we we' never even though it was alleged in a recent hit piece on us we would I would never ever ever cancel a guest for their ideological reasons we teat more diversity of thought on the show than any other new show there is uh so just want that said again for the record Max blumthal thank

Consulting   joining us  now live  to talk  about all of  this  Thank you  so much for taking  the time   to  be  here  with us today.   Thanks, Josh  Always good  to be here  with  you.   for sure  Now my  first  question  for you when  we   find  out from  officials  there in  Israel  that  the  six hostages  have been  killed  murder they say.   while Hamas have  them  in   captivity.  Is  any of that?   surprising  to  you as   somebody  who did work  in?  hostage negotiations? and  things of that  nature?  No, it's  really not   unfortunately.  having  done   so  many  of these. you see  it  and it  it  first  happened. I thought the same   thing it's  not like  you  want  to take hope  away   from  anyone's   family and stuff. But when   we  need  when you see   enough  of  these you really   start to  look  at  the bad  side, right  from the beginning. knowing  that  it  was a violent  encounter to even take  them.  and how things  were going.  I thought that  was possible.  I thought it was most likely.  scenario. Era, that would  happen  that  some  some   would be  killed  either   during  the taking. maybe  trying to escape  or   actually  during   a captivity.  And there's  been  questions about the  health  and the safety  of   hostages  that  were  taken  by  Hamas on  October 7th.  I  hate  to  even  ask  the question  but is  it   likely  that  there are more?  of  those hostages? who are  no longer?  alive.  I do   think that  is. most  likely.  and I think that's  kind  of   where things  started.   bogging down  and  negotiations. Israel  and  everyone  else  was thinking   that  there's so  many  like   240 whatever  the figure   was.  and Hamas knowing that.  figure   which is not actually what   they  had.  based on.  you know, the murders and  killing during  captivity or   taking  them. and then   something that  could have   happened  on the line.  So   I think I think you  would have  saw if  they   were quote  killed  in.  an Israeli  raid. a  moss would have played  that   to  the fullest.  and  would have  probably  been   trying  to  get more  the  victims placed  in   something like  that  like   Isis  did on  a couple of  them, but I think  I think we're going to  come   to  a satyr conclusion  on   how many  are actually   alive.  and we've heard some   very  disturbing. details  from  the hostages  and from   their families  the man said   that  his young nephews were   talking very  young.  or   branded with  a motorcycle   exhaust pipe  in  case  they   were  to  run away. Is  that   something that  you see  happen? Is  that  a common   tactic  of  any kind? No, I  haven't seen  that  when  you  when you  send that to me  earlier.  when  I was looking  at  it. I'm like  I've never   seen. hostages  branded like   that. a lot of  the hostages   there that we deal  with   like  you have an American.  that's  held  in  Pakistan   by  the haqqanis  or  the  Taliban.  I don't think  anyone  getting away  would  get away  very  far without  being understood  that   they're American. so  I  haven't heard that  before   and I and it's  one of those   Rarities. He's that I  think's coming  out when?  when  they start  talking to   the hostages  you're  going  to  start hearing the truth  come  out.  and that's   one thing I know  Hamas.   really  understood  like   when  we  release them. some   of the  horrors that  they   went through  some  of  the  torture and obviously.   some of these things  are  going to come out and then   hopefully people   are going to  understand   that  this  wasn't  what   people  were  thinking   all that  they're being cared  for.  and taking  great care   of. I think the first  ones that came  out had some   stores  like  that. but  they were also, I'll be  treated that way  and  knowing that  they're going  to  be  some  of the  first  to be released. and  Netanyahu.  has apparently  I  should  say reportedly   called  way some of the  negotiation teams out of   cutter. Does  that  indicate   that  there is  likely  to   not be  a ceasefire?  another  deal  anytime soon? I think I  think it's  pressure. I think  it's  pressure  that  it is  going to  be  putting on   this. I also  think it's   emotional.  It's   frustrating.  to  start  hearing these things  and it   was hopefully just not the   whim of the moment  type  of   thing but it's  a calculator.  Hey look, these things are   coming  out.  We're going to   pull  our people  out.   but we're serious about  turning.  the air and  bound War back  on. I think  is a  play that they  have   and that  they're probably   going to  take  what  do we  know  about the hostages   that  do remain in  Gaza  as   you mentioned?  It's   possible  that  you know,  some of them  are no  longer   living  We  don't know  the  exact number  at  this   point.  What  do we know   about those hostages   overall?  Well, I think the  the Intel debriefing  of  the  ones  that  were  released.  the I'm sure  that  they   have  people  sitting down.  and they're really  trying   to  gather  as  much   information.  as  a kind of  where they  were  held   descriptions. TimeWise  and  it  takes those people   a little  bit.  a little   while.  to  go  back  and  really  start picking up  on   all those things. So  when   we  we debrief  is it it's a   matter of weeks?  so  I think  all the hostages  that  were   released. some  were probably  very  in tune with  it. and  then  some  they're just   having the  tell  the story  and get out.  What's  there  and having  two in tell folks  really  pull  out what  is   Intelligence  on?  what some of the  other?   hostages  are at or what   you're going through now? I  want to get your  take  on   this  because we  have  seen   over  the past  several days   as  those groups  of   hostages  were  released.  that  Did come  in  of   people  giving  high fives   to  the Hamas?  militants?   after they  were  being  released  or  while they   were  in the  process of   being released. Is that some   kind  of  I guess propaganda?  tactic  That  is  used  to   kind of release that  video  and show  Hey we were well   taken care  of. It  is.  when you  look  at,  0 the whole Stockholm  syndrome  and all that. when   someone's held  in   captivity.  everything.  their daily life  is  based  on. the the hostage giving   it  to  them. food.  sleep water.  Everything   is there. so  they  in  order  to  survive.  they  get to   this  then  and they  get  very  very  Barry everything   has to  come  from  so  they   get to   a point where they have this   liking  to  them, but it's  a  survival  Instinct  and Hamas  is  taking  advantage of  the  fact  that  when  they   release their is  Overjoyed  that  they're being released.  Maybe one of  the hostage  taker was a little  nicer was  the one that   was bringing him food and  water.  but you can't put any  they're held  hostage and  they were taken in horrible.   situations and  they  were   tortured  and they  again  some of them  were. were   murdered. but they're playing  that  high-five thing. That  is  a moment  of  jubilation.  and everything  that   over the  last  how many   days  came  from  these  people. that  they  have   these gut instinct, but it   is  definitely  not.  what   most  people  playing in  as   and we  do  know, of  course   as  I mentioned that   Netanyahu has pulled  those  negotiation teams out of   Qatar,  but I imagine we're  not going to be made  aware  of  all of  the different  back and  forth that  is   going on  behind. closed   doors at  this  point because  I imagine they  don't want   a lot of  that  to be public   so that UI anyone out there  there knows What  the deal   is  right?  Yeah. this  is   so odd  the fact that  they're there.  negotiating  all our negotiations  in the   US  were  always  kind  of   behind  closed  doors.  and  all these backdoor things  were  going on  Anyhow these   side  deals and everything   else. So  the fact that these  were  more  public  is   kind of a first but yes,   there's now maybe some  more   urgency or  some  Panic on   one side  or the other. but  those deals are still going  through the qataris are still  reaching  out.  They  No.  know Israel is  not it is  very  upset with   what's coming out.  so  that   they're going to  try to   have to have  a side  deal   sweet a deal to get them   back. and then  if the   ground  war starts   in the air war  starts   again.  then  again Hamas is   going to  be  on  the  defensive of  well, we're not  but it's  all still going on   in the  background  and it's   going to  continue  on  as   long  as  they  have   hostages  long  as  this   ground war are War. there's  going to be going on. Robert   D'Amico.  Thank you as always  for taking  the time  to   join  us  and help  break it   down  anything  you want to  add Before  I Let You Go.  No, it's  just  this  is   that  roller coaster   that I talked about?  before   that. unfortunately  that families are going up   and down. even  the ones   that  were  recovered or   going to  have  a lot of   guilt and association with   why did I get released  and  and the others  that  are in   there?  It's  Just  it's   never a good  thing and it's   in  it's going  to  play  on   them  for years.  All right,   Robert. Thank you again for  taking  the time  to  be   here.

It   is  therefore especially   regrettable that  instead of   campaigning for their  unconditional release.  un   agencies  have  been  urging   Israel  to  leave the Hamas  rapist  regime  in  power.   to  them we say,  if  anyone   thinks  we are  going to   abandon those vulnerable   hostages  in  the hands of   the Hamas rapist  regime  get  out of our  way.  away  this   week  survivors of the  Hamas  Terror  Dungeons and   relatives of the  remaining  hostages  have been  testifying  before  the  knesset.  about these  psychological.  physical  and  sexual  abuse.  that  the  Hamas rapist  regime  has  been  perpetrating  against  the hostages  hostage  eliyahu Cohen has been   denied  Red Cross access   despite suffering from   epilepsy  one of  many   medically vulnerable.  hostages  including Hirsch,  Goldberg  Pollan who  had his  arm blown off and Omer   Shem, Tov.  who suffers from   asthma  survivor  of  Eva's  Siegel who's hot?

There is  a  diplomatic  window  which we   strongly  prefer. to  stop   hezbollah's aggression  by   peaceful means  and that   diplomatic  window  is   narrow. Hezbollah,  and it's   Iranian warlord patrons are  dragging  Lebanon into  an   unnecessary War.  with  their  non-stop rocket fire at  Northern  Israel  Hezbollah  has two choices.  back  off.   or  be  pushed  away.

They   want  to  commit  further  acts of genocide  just  like   they  did on  October 7th,   and the state of  Israel   remains firm  in its  resolve  to  destroy Hamas and  continue  fighting  to bring   back  all of  the hostages.  and ensure that the Gaza   Strip can never again pose   a threat  to  the people  of   Israel  not like  I did on   October 7th and not like  it   did in the  preceding 20   years of  Rocket  fire.

are on going after another night of Israeli bombardments across the strip in a moment we'll go to Rory Chalin he's an occupied East Jerusalem for us to get Israeli reaction on proposals for a ceasefire first let's go live to hany Mahmud he's in Rafa in southern Gaza hany has news of possible ceasefire agreement reached where you are what are people saying about it yes melan well people are uh looking forward to hearing more constructive reports about The a possible ceasefire and a possible end to the ongoing war on on the Gaza Strip they're looking into an end all hostilities and and into the masing of Palestinians as it's happening right now now despite the ongoing bombing campaigns within the past two days that has intensified across the G STP mainly in KH Unis and the northern part of the Gaza Strip people are still hopeful that those emerging reports started to come out within the past two days are going in fact to lead into an agreement between the Palestinians particularly fighting groups and Hamas mainly and the Israeli side that will include not only in the war and an immediate ceasefire increase in the humanitarian uh aid but also release of all Palestinian prisoners including those who were detained from Gaza the the northern part as the war was as the war still continuing including miners in exchange of course for the release of the Israeli captives inside the the Gaza STP people are hopeful they're looking forward to having that in fact here all day long we get more questions from people who are passing by our sites and and just judging from the the number of questions and the level of of of questionings that we get is that they are eager as they are growing tired exhausted they traumatized and they want an end to their displacement they don't want it to be permanent they want to be able to go back to their homes in the northern part in Gaza c as they have been displaced for four months right now and it's it's about time they said as we hear from them to go back and to look after their family mainly provide them with with the most secret thing they have been entrusted on providing them which is protection and safety as so far they are lacking any sense of security and safety as they are squeezed in the overcrowded part of the gas STP in in Rafa City yeah it's no surprise that they are desperate for a ceasefire because there's been again more overnight Israeli raids across Gaza at talk us through the situation on the ground the aftermath particularly at the hospitals which have been under siege yes well that's exactly the torture before death and that's what have people have been frustrated about despite the the talks and the emerging reports about a possible deal between the Palestinians and the the Israeli side is just the they seeing more intense bombing campaign and particularly around the city of Han unun and around vicinity of hospitals for the third time Hospital have been stormed by this really military the large deal of the facilities and the properties were severely damaged more people are being injured and more people killed inside the the facility including displaced Palestinians and and employed security guard employed by the Palestinian Rick Crescent the hospital in a statement said that they're dealing with a more than 10 critically injured displ Palestinians inside the the facility including since the past 12 hours almost 12 people were killed inside the facility the the the situations around Naser Hospital not are no different there is more fighting going on more bombing to the vicinity of the hospital and its facilities the courtyard is mainly taken over by attack drones quad capts that are preventing any movements inside the hospital in addition the the fact that it it's an intense finding most of the medical staff have have has already left the hospital so we're talking about large number of injuries of people inside the facility but a small and insufficient number of medical staff that is unable to provide any sufficient medical attention whatsoever in the Central Area also reports of more residential buildings being targeted in an and Al ra camp and this is the pattern we've been seeing since the beginning of the war we have refugee camps particularly in the central area and the northern part repeatedly attacks and with with large amount of Firepower and attack aggressively impact okay thank you for that hanim Mahmud there for us in southern Gaza let's go now to Rory challeng he's an occupied eism for us Rory so a lot of debate in the last 24 hours or so about a possible ceasefire deal would what are you hearing where you are yeah it's worth a recap isn't it because the humanitarian and the military aspects of this proposed deal are kind of overlaid by many tears of politics so let's go through them hamas's position is that they will only agree to a deal which ultimately sees an end to the War uh an Israeli military pull out of Gaza an enter the siege of Gaza and a serious uh prisoner exchange process Benjamin Netanyahu says that he won't agree to a deal that ends the war so the war from his perspective will go on the Israeli military will stay in Gaza and as he puts it they will not release thousands of terrorists but Netanyahu is under huge pressure from the far right flanks of his own governing Coalition and particularly it's Amar Ben gavier the national security minister does not trust Netanyahu over any deal thinks that he's trying to pull what he's calling a goat Clause kind of sneak his way to something that the far rights will not find acceptable and he says that he is willing to pull out of the governing Coalition if Netanyahu signs up to something that releases thousands and thousands of what Ben uh Ben Vehicles murderers essentially so into all of this Wades y laid the opposition leader main opposition leader who says that he is willing to offer Netanyahu a safety net not to save Netanyahu himself but to save the captives he believes that it's the captives that should be kept at the top of everyone's agenda here and that that's the most important thing getting those captives out of Gaza everyone here is setting their red lines everyone is is talking to their own particular audiences there is no easy solution uh and as we go forward if we get to a deal it's likely that many of these red lines are going to be quietly forgotten if this is anything like the previous deal back in uh the Autumn of last year then we might not find out the details of it until very late in the day possibly only once the actual exchanges and the ceasefire uh has begun because nothing is really written in stone yet indeed uh a slightly different uh matter there's been more Israeli criticism of unra the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency uh what does the Prime Minister had to say about it again yeah we know as we have done for a long time that Netanyahu is no fan of anra this relief agency that basically looks after the humanitarian Affairs of of many many hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza there has been uh this campaign against anra uh the uh release of information showing that anra employees as the Israeli say were uh members of or at least assisting in the Hamas attacks of October the 7th so Netanyahu most recently has been briefing ambassadors of the UN who have come here and he's basically mean telling them that unra needs to be disbanded says that the mission has to end anr's mission he says that anra is self-perpetuating I.E it keeps alive the the Palestinian refugee issue therefore meaning that the agency that looks after Palestinian refugees is essential he says that anra has helped South Africa in its case against Israel at the international court of justice and as we hear now from Netanyahu in this particular sound bite he's also saying that anat self has been riddled essentially with there are other agencies in the UN there are other agencies in the world they have to replace onra onra is totally infiltrated with Kamas it has been in the service of Kamas in its schools and in many other things I say this with great regret because we hope that there would be uh an objective and constructive body to offer aid but is not just reserving criticism for unra he's also criticizing the entirety of the UN which he thinks has been unfair in its treatment of Israel he says that there are parts of the world he names Iran and Yemen where there is as he puts it savagery and aggression and that therefore the un's dealing with Israel and its issues with the Palestinian territories is biased okay thank you for that Rory challenge there for us and occupy the East Jerusalem"}, "bv-Iobn-Cbs": {"url":

death stol amongst Israeli soldiers keeps rising and over 100 hostages still remain in Gaza and Hamas is still standing more Israelis are vocally pushing back against Netanyahu and his farride

the world over netanyahu's rejection of Palestinian statehood un Secretary General Antonio gues has said last week's clear and repeated rejection of the two-state solution at the highest levels of the Israeli government is unacceptable this refusal and the denial of the right to statehood to the Palestinian people would indefinitely prolong a conflict that has become a major threat to Global Peace and security such an outcome would exacerbate polarization and embolden extremists everywhere gutes has called for the universal recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to build their own fully independent state Netanyahu has drawn Global condemnation in recent days and defied even his closest Ally the United States which provides Israel with billions of dollars in military aid by rejecting calls for a Palestinian State yesterday was one of the hardest days since the war broke out we lost 24 of our best Sons the heroes who fell defending the Homeland together with the citizens

than 150 members of our own staff following the horrific Terror attacks by amas on 7 October this is artbreaking and utterly unacceptable the Middle East is a Tinder Box we must do all we can to prevent conflict igniting across the region and that starts with an immediate humanitarian ceasefire to relieve the suffering in Gaza allow humanitarian Aid to reach everyone in need and facilitate

Qatar on a ceasefire and prisoner exchange deal that would be a deal for an exchange of prisoners between Hamas and Israel Ibrahim freat is associate professor of conflict resolution at the Doha Institute it's good to have you with us on set to discuss this if this happens still a big if at this stage negotiations ongoing but if this happens it would obviously be major it will be a huge breakthrough depending however on the terms of the ceasefire um and for how long is it going to be a humanitarian ceasefire is it going to be a temporary ceasefire is it going to be an end of this war so this we don't know yet and we don't have a news any any of that what we know however I'll add I'll add a little something these negotiations can be characterized right now we have to be careful with the words we use based on the sourcing and everything but they they can be described as progressing the negotiations are progressing and they're currently at an advanced stage exactly no matter what the terms are it's still a huge breakthrough because we know that there has been a very strong Israeli rejection to any sort of ceasefire even a humanitarian ceasefire even the International Community the European Union yesterday in the meeting was calling for a humanitarian sees far and they were a bit shy of even saying this so there isn't any serious pressure on Israel from the European Union and we know that the US has said several days now that a ceasefire in their view would benefit Hamas and that's why the US has been against one exactly um but nevertheless Israel the United States also they're so concerned about the issue of the prisoners or the the arrested Israelis with with Hamas um and this is an important factor for for the domestic level in the United States and that's let's keep in mind that Dom in the US and in Israel yes exactly and let's keep in mind that the US the US Administration Biden is approaching a new election uh soon so this is the domestic factor is very crucial um as for the United States so there has been some pressure from the US to on Israel to delay the ground operation in order to release the hostages um on that level but um and we have seen some of that impact actually though we don't know the real reasons why Israel has not been uh conducting the ground operations yet one of the explanations that they're scared of the results of what this will happen and the impact on the again the Israeli domestic level for the Israeli government sorry go ahead yeah but but again uh let's keep in mind that this is an important uh development this is a huge break breakthrough even for a short term term uh but then we need to know if this is going to continue to be a temporary it's not going to benefit Hamas a lot it's going actually to benefit the US and it's going to benefit Israel because this will give Israel a free hand is to conduct more ground operations or for a long time well there are two things right that are being discussed one is the ceasefire one is a potential prisoner exchange now the ceas fire we would have to know and we don't at this stage whether again it's temporary or permanent would it be the first step to Wards ending the bombardment and then some some resolution to this uh conflict that we just don't know that's still a question mark the other uh thing that is being discussed is a potential prisoner exchange again there's a lot of information we don't have but there's a lot of context that's important and that we do have when after Hamas carried out its operation on October 7th there were statements from Hamas saying we have enough captives to free all the Palestinians in uh Israeli jails we know that you know these things have happened before with gilad Shalit he was held captive uh for 5 years and when he was an Israeli soldier gach when he was um released it was he was released in exchange for more than a thousand Palestinian prisoners yeah um I think it's in my own analysis it's still early to talk about a prisoners exchange okay because this is going to take a long time there are 6,000 approximately 6,000 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jail U so Hamas announced many times that the time is not Tri now uh for a prisoners exchange and no prisoners exchange will happen before the end of the Israeli War on Gaza so I think so that's why these two things are linked the EAS fire and the and the talks about the prisoners so I think we are talking probably more likely on some some sort of um an exchange with the civilian hostages with Hamas not the because there are two types of hostages with Hamas civilians and Military so and there is high ranked military Israeli military officials are captives with with Hamas at the moment also so probably at this moment we are talking about ceasefire and along with the U civilians uh hostages with Hamas more than a total prisoners exchange because this is would still be a huge step and Israel has many many many vetos on releasing um you know Palestinian prisoners um you know for for the number of like 10,000 6,000 sorry 6,000 prisoners so um again let's hope that there is going to be a ceasefire it's not going to be temporary and it's going to take some time you know for this that something can be built on such even if it's temporary again I think it's still a great progress because some something can be built on later and also let's keep in mind that the developments in the region are not are not helping the United States so there are some sort of developments uh instability taking place in Syria in in Iraq against American American targets oh you think the wider Regional context is something that might that that might play into these negotiations of course of course this is the major pressure point on the us Administration that the US Administration does not made it so clear from day one does not have time for that us larger agenda is Ukraine Russia China it's not this war and for that reason the US finding itself is being pulled into this they felt compelled they felt compelled um to send two aircraft carriers uh just going to remind our viewers of this information on aljazera that there are negotiations going on right now at an advanced level mediated by T this on a ceasefire in Gaza and a potential exchange deal for prisoners between Hamas and Israel that's what we can report at this hour it is 1321"}, "lODPP7f1LBI": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lODPP7f1LBI", "video_id": "lODPP7f1LBI", "description": "Israel releases 39 Palestinian prisoners from

I want  to   turn  now.  over  to   Jonathan  Panic off with  the  Atlantic  Council an  expert   following the latest  in  the  Middle East we  continue  to   follow  Jonathan  this  major  news  breaking  today and  developing  really   throughout  the day with   some  twenty four hostages   being released  from  Hamas.   from  Gaza  into  the  thirteen  Israelis   We're also learning a number   of  people  from  Thailand   and at  least one Filipino.  resident  we  also   learned that  some   Thirty Nine prisoners  are being released. from  a  prison  in  Israel. These are  Palestinians  who  were accused  of  certain  crimes  there.  and  they're now being exchanged  in  this  prisoner  swap.  Perhaps a huge  development.   in  this  case.  I want to ask you you know,  your latest reaction  to this  your  breakdown of   everything. that's  happening  as  follow it.  today  Thanks so much for having me.  looked  obviously I think of   positive  development.   any time that there's an   opportunity.  for the  Israelis  to  get out the  hostages  who have  now been   in  Moscow  captivity for  seven weeks.  when   you're talking  about  children  some of the people   Children  release today  were as young as three.  elderly citizens, I think the  oldest  One released  was 88   so  there's no  reason   these people  ever  should   have  been  obviously in   captivity and having  the  released  as a  positive.  this  pause though  gives  herbs humanitarian  relief   efforts and opportunity to   get into  to  food. water.   fuel. medical supplies  are  going to  flow  in  over   the next  few days. So  long   as  the temporary  humanitarian  suspension   lasts.  and if that happens  and that's  positive  and  it's  obviously going to be  opportunity for continuation   as  well  Israel  has said   that  it will continue  the  humanitarian  pause.  one day  for every 10  additional.  hostages  that are  released   will  have  to  wait  to see   if  that  comes to fruition.   but certainly a positive   step. for Israel  to  begin  to  get their hostages  back.  from  Hamas.  now my   understanding is that this   hostage release is  expected   to  be  expanded  meaning  these aren't the  only   hostages  expected to be   released  as  a part  of   this. Ford a ceasefire. What   can you tell  me  about that?  That's  right.  So there's   about 50  total that   have been agreed  to  50.  hostages  being held  by   Hamas and other Palestinian  groups. I think  it's important  to  note that  that  Hamas doesn't hold  all  of  them. And so  there are  complications there.   internally between  intra  Palestinian factions. but in   exchange  Israel  supposed   to  release a number  of   women and minors  from   prison, that's  it's holding   at  a 3 to 1 ratio, so  150  prisoners from is really   jails is  supposed to be   released  in exchange for a  total of  50  hostages   over the  next  four days  including today,  But again,   that  can be  extended  if   it's  something that  Hamas  is  willing to  do  and  ready to  do. one day.  of   additional. humanitarian.  pause.  for each  10  more   hostages  that are  released   by  the group.  Is  there an   expectation that? fighting   could continue  is  there an   expectation?  that? the  ceasefire will  be? there an   at  least from  experts  looking at  this  situation?   it  you know. how safe  is   it  at this point?  I think  it's  certainly safe  from   the Israeli perspective that   the expectation. Is that  the  temporary.  humanitarian.  pause really  think.   what people are referring to   it  because it's not  a full   ceasefire It's  a a ceasefire  if  you will. I think it   probably  will  hold  or   that's  the goal  At  least  we've seen  a Hamas and  previous  episodes. go  back   on  its word. I think  given the dire  humanitarian.  situation it  would be   ill-advised to  do  so,  I think it's  you strong   reactions from  frankly  in this.  sent gazans  incredibly  unhappy if  the  humanitarian  supplies  stop   flowing over the  next  few  days. because Hamas broke the  pause I would be  very   shocked to be honest  If   Israel were to  break it  it   very much.  desperately  wants to  get as  many  of   its hostages  out.  as   possible  and return  safely   to  Israel, but at the  end  of  this  we saw   earlier this  morning that   these Israeli  defense minister you   have Gallant  said  very very  clearly.  We  will  resume   military. operations  when   the humanitarian  pause is   completed whether that's  for  days five days  six days. The  reality is  if  the military   operations  don't continue.  then  we  are in  truth  Israel's  security  is  not  much  better  than  it  was.   on  October.  6th.  And so   that's  going to  be the   challenge There's still a lot  of  fighting  left  to be  done  from   the Israeli perspective.   if there's  going to  up be  operations  that  have  to   begin I would imagine in  the  south of  Gaza  Israel  has  only  begun in  the north And  so  there's going to be  probably  much more fighting   to come on  the other side.  of  this  humanitarian   pause.  Yeah,  and that was going to be   another part  of  the  question  Is  there a  possibility that   the ceasefire last  longer?  of  course  shorter  is in question  as  well, but  is  there a possibility?   that  this  war?  could end  in  the wake of all this  or   is that unlikely? I think  it's  unlikely  Look, I think  this  sets the  precedent for  future  hostage exchanges and  Future. humanitarian  pauses   and exchange  for those  hostages. but the idea that  this  was going to  turn   into  a complete  and  permanent cessation of   hostilities.  I think is   unlikely  the reality is   Israel's security is  still  very  very  fragile  at the moment.  It's the   ending  the conflict  now  would give  Hamas not  only the  opportunity to   regroup and rearm  but it would  in power   and Israel  has a very   clearly and ironically  the  International Community  said very clearly that's not   acceptable. So  the Spanish  prime minister. who you just   showed  the clip  before.  spending has been on   among the leaders and really   pushing for our humanitarian   ceasefire.  among European   countries.  I think the  question  to those  leaders  is  everybody wants to  see  an  end of violence.  Nobody   wants innocence being killed   but who is  ensuring  and  guaranteeing  who is ensuring  you were  to  end the  hostilities now?  and because  nobody  can make  those.   guarantees  nobody  can  insured.  I think Israel's   view  really  and  understandably  is  that   it's  got no  choice  but to   continue  to  try and go   after Hamas to  decimate  the  group go  after  its leadership, which  has fled  to  the South of   Gaza. So  that's  why I would  expect  operations. really   to  continue   for quite some time.  um   time  in the  wake of this   current pause.  I do  we   know  who the hostages  are  that  are being released  by   Hamas as  well  as  who make   up  the people  who are being  released  as  prisoners from   Yeah, so  on. the homicide.  the hostages  being released   or  Only  Women and Children,  right now.  That  was  the deal  and only  civilian   women and children. So  there  are some. military. women who  are serving in  the  Israel Defense  Forces  who  would not be  part of  the deal. That would not be  eligible. Hamas.  provided a   list  in fact their delay  in providing  a list. for  frankly a number of weeks was  part of the delay in  some of  the negotiations. to  have   this. even  needle  to   that way. way in the end. was  this  three to one ratio. So   Hamas is  releasing its  supposed  to  be  a total of   50  women and children  over   the next  four  days. Israel   is  supposed to reciprocate  by  releasing 150 prisoners  also  women and minors. among  the miners  are boys   teenage boys  who have  been   arrested  for tax that  they   have  perpetrated either   in the  West  Bank. or  Gaza.  over  over the  this  year's   now Jonathan  we  had  mentioned those statements   from  the Israeli foreign  minister  speaking  earlier  today about obvious that   situation on  the ground  and  how unlikely  fighting  is   to  stop  in the  wake of  this  ceasefire.  once  those  four  days  are up. Let's go   ahead right now and let's  just  play  out and listen   in  to  what  he had  to say.  the foals for the safety  of   Israel  and we call today.   work with us. to  free Gaza.   Especially the growing   humanitarian.  humanitarian situation.  Getting worse and worse.  We   hereby  the day.  today.   Israel  allowing  a number   of  eight trucks  and  according to  the IDF more   than  they  have. released   in  the past  seven weeks.   how important is  that   Aid and how vital will that  be  to all the  folks on the   ground? and any hope  I  should  say.  for civilians  to  stop  being put in  the  crossfire.  of  the situation  as  Hamas and Israel.  duke it out.  is critical  there's been a  shortage  of   clean drinking  water.   a shortage of food.  a shortage of medicine  and  medical supplies. and a  shortage of fuel, right which  is  necessary.  for  electricity generation.  for desalinization. All of   the humanitarian  relief   that's going to be coming in   over  the next  four days is   frankly critical  for the  civilian. population.  Egyptians have  said  that   there will  be  well  over.  100 liters of fuel  push  the  into  Gaza a day. day I think  we're going to have to  see  in the  end.  how long   those supplies  laughs then  part  of that may depend  on.  Israel's  view  on  whether  or not  it  can take   another.  humanitarian  pause  in  a week  or two  weeks and  whether Famas is  ready to   release more  hostages. I  think it's also what's   going to  drive the  consumption rate is going to   drive a little  bit whether  or not  Hamas is  willing to   extend  the pause.  to   release another ten hostages.  for an  extra day of  a pause  can get to a fifth date.  Six  day of  seventh day I  think that  really  does   remain. somewhat. Unclear  I think the challenge for the  military. operations  is   that  for quite a while now  Israel  has really  tried to   push  people  toward  the  South.  not physically  not  literally but the warnings   through leaflets  it has  you  know  texted cell phones   to get  people  to  move   South,  in  order to  not be   In  Harm's Way. when  the  fighting  resumed some  of   it  is  still going to  be   in  the north and we're  already seeing  is  a number   of  folks who have been in   the South pushing back   forward North to  try to   return  to  their homes  despite Israel  announcing   through additional  leaflet.   not to  return  leaflet This   is  just  a pause.  that   obviously could create  a  really  troubling.   situation.  for 56 days from   now.  whenever   military operations.   resumed.  if  more of the  population  from  Gaza  has  returned  to  their homes  in the  North.  and  inner Harm's Way. ironically   Hamas.  issued a statement   encouraging people to return   home. almost  certainly  knowing that  then  it would   be  In  Harm's  Way and  increase  or  potentially  increase  the number of death  that would be associated. to   collateral  Damage  of   Civilian casualties.  because  of  Israeli targeting and  Military. operations. and  meanwhile Jonathan  we  are  expecting a statement any  moment  now from   US President  Joe Biden in   the wake of this  we're  taking  a live  look. out  at the  white house right  now,  but of  course  we know  the president today is  in   Massachusetts.  That's  where  he's going to be  delivering   these remarks.  What  do you   expect  to hear from  the  president?  and you think  he's  going to  continue  to   double  down  on  support for  Israel  and the wake of this?  What  do you expect?  Yeah,  it's a  great question. Look   I think the president is   going to  understandably  be   very  appreciative  of  the  role that cutter  has played   in  this  but I think he's   also  going to  thank you  take  a little  bit of  a  Victory lap that  by engaging  Israel  by  hugging Israel   so  tightly it  helped  to   push  the Netanyahu  Administration. towards  agreeing to this  ceasefire.   is  ceasefire.   Or I should say.  in doing   so  my senses that the   president will  view  his  strategy  as  working.   Obviously.  It's  upset a lot  of  people  here in the US   protest of continued  here.  including on left.  number   of folks  of  number  of   Democrats,  especially  who  have been more  upset about  how the president has.   addressed this. situation,   but I think the presidency   is  this  is  going to see   this  as  an indication that   your  strategy  is  working.   and not different than  an   op-ed He  published recently   the Washington Post  Bo's laying out that  she's  going to  continue to  stand by  Israel  Israel   still has  a security Challenge  and  Hamas that  doesn't go  away   just  because the  humanitarian  situation is   paused. We ultimately have   to  have  success in  both   ensuring  humanitarian  Goods  flow to the people of Gaza   the hundreds of thousands  millions of innocent   civilians.  and that  Israel   can ensure its own  security.  So  I do  expect  him to   continue  to  strongly   support.  Israel and its   operations  but I  expect his Focus  to  be on  the humanitarian  side.  getting a pause for the  people  of  Gaza  and getting  those hostages  out.   Meanwhile,  there are you  know  even  after this  for  a ceasefire and if  all 50   of  the Israeli hostages  are  released, there are still  some. 200 by  that  count  about 190 that  would  still be. in  custody of   Hamas.  still in  captivity.   any hope  for sake   safety and there's  there  even any  assurances  that   those people are  safe  right  now.  Unfortunately,  there's  no  assurances  Hamas is   already said  some  of  them.  are dead  and have  been   killed. They've cleaned  Some of them  were  killed   in  Israeli airstrikes  is   simply  no  way to  verify   either  that  they're dead   or  the reason  of the   cause.  of  their death,   which is  part of the problem  here. Israel  knows everybody  in  captivity.  but it   didn't  even  know  until  relatively  recently. the  names of those  who were   going to be chosen  by  Hamas  to  be  released. the other  challenge becomes.  not  all of the  hostages  are  held  by  Hamas the  Palestinian Islamic Jihad is   holding a number   of hostages.  and maybe other  smaller salafist groups.   in the  Gaza  Strip who  are holding hostages  Tomas  is  ultimately  responsible  for them. under Israel   Israel's  View  and under  international law.  but the  reality is  that  it's  going  to  be  a challenge.   There's not a lot of   guarantees  here, which is   why frankly,  I think Israel   also  would not be  upset to   extend. the deal. Well for   one or two  extra days  that   could mean an extra 10  or   20  hostages. in  the end My   sense is the  last  hostages   to  be  let go  and going to   be  those who are active   duty  military. Israel   Defense Forces  soldiers.  That's  generally how this   works civilians go first. but  we'll have to wait  and say  meanwhile from  an   operational perspective.   does this Perhaps the upper  hand  time  to  reload.  I know  it's  four days but  a pause in any  fighting   when  you have  tank  fire   and Rocket  Fire  coming  at   you.  What  will that mean   from  that  perspective  especially  for Hamas and  then  if  you could maybe  also  talked about  how that   impacts.  Israel's  fight as   well. Israel's fight as well.  Look, it's  surely going to  have  a little  bit of. give   him awesome bit of  a break.   There's no  way around  that   and certainly that  would  have  been  part of the  debate  by  Israel's   war cabinet and whether to   agree to  this  pause or   not.  but the amount  that   Hamas is  going to be able   to  regroup I think his  questionable  there's been   quite a bit of  reporting  that  morale  is  incredibly   incredibly  low.   There's been  some  rumors   that  the leadership  of   Hamas actually  fled  from   the north.  to the  south  of God. Gaza to try  and increase  their own  protection  and  ensure their survival.  Hamas  is  not going to  be  able   to  either  indigenously   produce or  have  transferred  from  Iran. on new  weapons  shipment  or  Rockets during   this  pause.  so  it   certainly does  give  them  a  little  bit of  a break a  chance  to  recoup. but it's   probably  not going to  give   them  nearly  enough  time.  to  militarily  rearm for  instance  in a  way  that would threaten Israel.  for Israel itself.  So  it   also  gives them  a break in   a chance  to  double  down   and on  their strategy. and  their strategic thinking   gives them  the chance  in a   break not during  operations   to  decide exactly  what   comes next. in   their military  planning   when  they  turn  South and  go  towards Southern  Gaza   exactly how to  do  that.  Israel was very clear IDF  Troops  are not leaving Gaza   and the north as  part of  this  pause.  They're  going to pause. right in   place so they can pick  up.  right when  they  begin.   it will give  IDF troops   a bit of a rest as well.  So   I don't think from  the  Israeli perspective  It's certainly going  to  be   particularly  harmful and I  don't think from  the Hamas  perspective.  It's  going to   be  particularly  helpful.   certainly a major.   developing  story here  as   we  continue to follow  this   here  on live now from  Fox  Jonathan. Panic off there  with  the Atlantic  Council.   always  appreciate  having   you on  to break   this stuff down.  Thing I  didn't  ask anything  that   you'd like to add.   as we continue   discussing this.  No. the  reality is  they  have been  the intermediary  because  they've been  on the  one  with  the ground  with  Hamas  for a number of years now.   with  Israeli acquiescence   to  transfer  money.  That   was part of the goal  to  try  to  keep. Hamas.  from   undertaking this  sort of  attack  Obviously.  That  was  a failed strategy.  a DE jure  but I expect  that  in the   coming  days  and weeks.   more   than one of your viewers   are going to  start to  hear   about culture about the role.  They  played in.   negotiations. and where  future  negotiations  need   alive because my   sense is it's going to  go   through cutter as well. Yeah   and Qatar has been   a strong Ally.  with  the  u.s. especially in  terms of   brokering.  a several  of these  deals in   Middle East including  a helping to provide  those  leaving Afghanistan as  well.  during  that  period  in time  so  a very  interesting.   relationship. I'm sure   we'll continue  discussing   it  as  that  Arab  Nation.  continues to  play  a role   in  helping to  perhaps  similar things  down  there  in the  region. as  it  has  been  a very  bloody.  fighting  over  the past   forty nine  days.

Israelis saying that they show Benjamin Netanyahu on the ground in Gaza Strip he's meeting and greeting troops taking advantage of this truce obviously he reiterated the three main objectives of this Israeli offensive to bring home hostages to destroy Hamas and to make sure that this never happens again I mean there is there is an element of theatric to this he is appealing he's showing these pictures for for for a domestic audience in Israel he wants to present himself after the awful attack and what happened on the 7th he wants to present himself as the man getting the job done and there is lots of pressure on him domestically because every day that goes by every hostage released Israeli Society gets more of an appetite and becomes used to the relief and Euphoria of hostages being released and he really does not want to be the man that that Israeli Society blames for that stopping and paric just more information on that development how is the hostage and prisoner exchange going at the moment yes so far we're not hearing about any delays it's happening as we speak uh it's been confirmed that 14 Israelis and three foreign Nationals they have been handed over to the Red Cross and red Cresent inside Gaza they're making their way to the raff of Crossing you may remember that that exchange moment is the really sensitive moment in all of this so everyone hoping that the day will continue as it did yesterday as my colleague Minnie Stevenson reports holding the hands of Hamas militants 9-year-old Emily hand on the left and 12-year-old hila sashani among 17 hostages released by Hamas after fraud 11th Hour diplomacy And Delay to free them this cordial sounding Fair feeling all the more surreal by goodbye as they wave goodbye to their caps after 7 weeks held hostage the relief palpable as 9-year-old Emily is finally reunited with her dad Thomas on the night of October the 7th the Irish Israeli school girl was at a sleepover when she was kidnapped at one point her dad was told his daughter had been killed they just said we found [Music] Emily uh she's dead in the Israeli hospital where some of the hostages are being treated with many more still being held captive they choose their words carefully happy to say that despite the fact that the uh harsh conditions they have been under and the um experience of captivity they did not um require any emergent medical uh intervention while in the West Bank City of Alber there are moments of joy as the Israelis released 39 Palestinian prisoners among them teenager roohi Kazmir hugs his parents his dad yassa says he feels a mix of emotions I feel happy but this Joy is intertwined with the blood of Martyrs and the suffering of children and the elderly in the West Bank funerals are held after Palestinian Health officials say at least eight people were killed by Israeli forces meanwhile in Gaza the temporary truce has allowed the largest delivery of Aid since the start of the latest conflict according to the UN reaching areas in the north for the first time in a month while today Palestinians continue to carry the weariness of War both sides making it clear this pause is anything but permanent well earlier I spoke to shiron lifet whose parents were both taken hostage by Hamas on October the 7th her mother was released on the 24th of October and famously shook the hands of her captor and wished them Shalom I began by asking Chiron whether she'd received any news about her father who was still being held by Hamas one of the hostages that came back actually told us that she saw him alive so this is the first time we have confirmation that he arrived alive um it's 51 days now and we finally know that he did arrive alive so that's great news obviously he is not on the list at the moment there is a long long way to go this is really really a very fragile moment for everybody on so many levels it's such a difficult time when do you hear that someone is on the list or someone's not how does that process even work oh there's a lot of rumors and the the the the officer that is liing on on behalf of the family let us know if our father is on the list and or not so there's many rumors but above all there's a sense of great happiness for each person and each family that are united with some of their loved ones it must be such a mix of emotions for you right now seeing people getting out and then knowing that your own father still is possibly held hostage I just wonder how you're feeling at the moment um I feel on I feel besides myself most of the time some of the time I can really relate to something to the good news or to the fear that it will break above all we feel very very determined to continue because we still have over 200 hostages and um they're feeling among the family very strongly is that we all have to work together and raise as much awareness as possible so that uh more and more people get released um and also particularly at the moment because this is the third night and four night are confirmed but there's very clear possibility of more hostages is being released in the following days our feeling is that everybody must come together at this point and do everything possible to release more of the hostages shiron your mom came home um earlier on and I just wonder how she's been doing and how she's been able to process what she's been through my mom is very very sharp she's uh very much U involved in what is happening she worked very hard over the last week with the authorities here in Israel with the Ministry of Health with the ministry of interior to prepare for the return of the hostages there's huge complexities to the situations there are children who come back but the parents were murdered there's children who are still there there's mothers that was stayed behind but the child was returned all of us are gone through an enormous trauma she'll know more than anyone what those first days or first hours are like out of um being a hostage um I just wonder if she's managed to talk to others about what to expect what to do and what can you do it's about being very patient giving back the sense of uh control over one's life because part of being a hostage is the total elimination of a sense of control over your being and your destiny and your actions and just finally Chiron there's a sense of loss that people are reflecting on now that we've got this pause the numbers of people who have died in Gaza as well when you reflect when you think about that how do you feel right now it feels me up with en normal sadness it fills me up also with the feeling that there's so much trauma on both sides so much loss of lives I hope that when this hor horrible episode is finished something better can happen for the people of this region we deserve better shiron Lett thank you very much indeed for joining us thank you you're welcome thank you for having me thousands of people have joined a March against anti-Semitism in London on Friday the Metropolitan Police said the number of anti-Semitic offenses they' recorded was up over a th% compared to October last year the organizers of today's March said it's a sad truth that Jews do not feel safe in our Capital City Jane de reports this was organizers say the biggest March against anti-Semitism in Britain since the 1930s at the front some famous faces and the chief Rabbi feelings of sadness that it's necessary for us to Stand Here feelings of pride in the fact that there are so many Jewish people and so many friends of the Jewish people who recognize that a threat to the Jews is a threat to all of our society the demonstrators were flanked by police in London in October there was a ten-fold increase in anti-semitic offenses compared to the same month last year people said they were frightened to show their Jewish scary I I can't speak my language I can't speak Hebrew I have to be careful around who I am like where I am it's not it's not the best feeling but we we have to show support we have to show that we care it feels scary that um the tide seems to be turning against the Jewish people in this country it's all very worryful because you know I'm nearly 80 so I don't like the idea but I'm going to come here and walk because I think we have to do that we have to say we exist yesterday Pro Palestinian demonstrators marched through the capital 18 people were arrested for offenses including inciting racial hatred the campaign against anti-Semitism says anyone who marched alongside them is complicit ahead of today's March some of your communication talked about those who perhaps marched yesterday calling for support for the Palestinians as being complicit in anti-Semitism a lot of people on that March would be feel very hurt by that including Jewish people so well look if um you march for seven weeks alongside people who are calling for the elimination of the state of Israel who threatened Jews who were caught on video saying things like Hitler was right and you do nothing about it then what are we meant to think you know occasionally at our events we get people from the far right who turn up when they do turn up we have them removed and today the police did remove the former leader of the English Defense League Tommy Robinson he tried to join the March even though organizers said they didn't want him or his supporters anywhere near the event the Met said it had arrested a 40-year-old man for refusing to comply with a direction to disperse bring them home bring them home the demonstrators continued towards Parliament the organizers estimate 60,000 people were here saying no to anti-semitism"}, "vLmE_2DkSME": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLmE_2DkSME", "video_id": "vLmE_2DkSME",

So  let's bring  in  Mike  Lyons our retired  US  Army  Major.  Thank you  so much for taking  the time   to  be  here  with  us  this   morning.  We  appreciate  it.  Hey,  thanks  Josh. Thanks   for having  me. all right,   so  first off I kind of  want to go  back  to  basics   here. What  do  we  know  so   far about the US  air strikes  over  in  Iraq? and Syria  help  break it down for me.  Yeah, very  significant.  uh   over  85 targets  hit.  uh,  multiple. Precision launch   guided  missiles  were  used   B1  bomber  coming  from  the  US. did not use the assets   currently in  the Middle   East  to  to  to  perform  This  attack  tells me   they're trying to keep  the  powder  dry for what   they're doing.  Um, you know,  it  is  more  than  just  a  punch in  the nose. It  is   something that  was  extensive.  Uh, you might  argue that  it was   telegraphed on  some  level  but um, but if  we're going  after 2 primary objectives   the first 1 would have been  leadership, I think that   that  would have  something  that  the military  would  like  to  have  taken care   of  right away. Uh, but but  really  if  we  didn't   strike  within the  first 48   hours after we  were   attacked  that  you were   going to  lose  that  that   that  group anyway  they   were  going to  scatter to   the winds,  but the second  1  was this  logistical supplies  and it  seems as  though   we've hit these some  of   these targets before  but now  seriously have  damaged them   and seriously taken away of a  lot of  their capability   What  what  they've done  is   there's a there's a land   bridge  that  runs  from   Iran through  Iraq  into   Syria that  allows  um  the  Iranians  to  resupply  these  Shia  militia groups  along  these Road  networks  there  within  these certain Supply   points  and the US  went   and attacked  most  of  them   and I think they're going to   continue  that  attack  here   in the  coming  days, I think  it's  going to  be  more  of   a campaign  not just  a a  1-time  deal. And I do  want   to  ask a question  that   has been  asked.  a lot here   and that  is  what  is the   ultimate  goal  of  these  strikes.  Are we  talking  destroying  military   headquarters? are we  talking  about?  sending a message or   a strong  message or  are we   talking about a mixture of   of  both  their?  I think the  Strategic goal  is  to   restore a level of   deterrence  that  uh   prevents. these groups. Uh,  and with  the Iranian  influence to  stop  attacking  US  forces. It  looks like   the red line  was uh   American  forces  that  were   killed  there We've got a  couple  of  thousand  troops   that  are stationed inside   of  Syria in  the northern   part of Iraq, you know, I was  surprised that  this  group  frankly was inside  of   Jordan, uh, technically uh   from  a political  perspective.  that's   difficult for that  for that   country to  kind of explain  that  away  as  it has  the  Palestinian population  to   it. Um, but we  have  troops   there and they're fighting   Isis  and they're working on   the things. about making   sure  that  terrorism doesn't  spread. and so  the the issue  is  making  sure  that   they're protected and we   don't want  them  attacked   In  fact  some of these  Shema groups we were  working  with  years ago to  to  fight  against Isis. Um, but uh  in   the second  the second   message,  it  goes  to  Iran.  uh  in that to  get control  of  these groups. not only   the ones  that  are in that  region, but also, In  Yemen  the houthis I think are  another uh  real  problem.   set for the Iranians  to   take  control of  as  what   they're doing in the  Red Sea  controlling those Maritime.  uh  threatening those  Maritime  sea Lanes attacking  US troops and forces  there  the Navy  the Destroyers   there as well.  So  I think  that's  a there's a 2-fold   message.  It's  it's  the  restored  deterrence. against  US forces and then  number   2.  Send a  message to  Iran   to  say basically get all  your  proxies on  a leash.   You talked about  this   a little  about in the  first  question  there,  but there's  been  some. criticism against  Biden and his administration   and the US  for waiting  several days  to  strike   back. and I just  want to get  your  opinion here  Is  that   a Fair  criticism?  Well   Josh, you can argue that  it   was telegraphed and it  just   shows our confidence  of  the  fact  that  we  were  going  to. you know, have  an  air  strike  without any concern  for example about air defense  systems that  are there.   There's nothing that  that   took  out the US. uh  attack,  uh, uh  planes  that  that   did this  operation.  Uh, but  I do  think that  if  the  initial uh  strike  didn't   take  place within  the first  24  to  48  hours we  weren't  going to  get any real   targets of  value of  of   their leadership  they  were   going to  immediately  scattered so  the clock was  running as  soon as that   that  took  place.  and  I think once  that  that   that  that  the time  passed   and we  didn't  do  anything   then  it  just  made  a lot  more  sense.  to  just  not  have  this  visceral   response. uh  from  a  military  perspective.  Uh,  let the let the soldiers  uh,  that  came  home. Let let  that  that  dignified event  take  place.  and then  and  then  do  something once   once  all that  was done. So   I I think at the  end of  the  day this  was the better   decision  Want to talk  about  some  statements  here  that   have  been  released  and  we're going to  start with   1 by  Iran's  president who?   I mean. sent  a threat  to   the us on Friday, which isn't  really  anything  new but  said  quote it  will  not  start a war.  but if  a  country if  a cruel Force  wants to  bully us. the  Islamic Republic  of  Iran   will  give  a strong.  response. What  do you  make   of  that  statement?  Well   in  some  ways  that   statement is  for their  internal  consumption any  kind of authoritative State  like  this  has issues   internally  maintaining the  power.  Um  the the inside   Iran  itself  the people   are are repressed.  Um, not  a lot.  of  you know   positive  things  going on   there and and uh  the the  authoritative nature  of   that  government  means that   they always have  to  be,  you know  clamping  down  so   I think that  statement more   is  for internal   consumption.  as  look, Iran   now has been  the the the  subject of  terrorism we  saw  back  a couple  weeks ago.   that  attacked the took place  in  keran.  We  see the  Iranians  striking  into   Pakistan. separatist  groups   there there are inside   groups  of  in  inside  of   Iran  that  want to overthrow  that  government  there so   they  have  to  do  all they   can to  maintain  their  power.  uh in in  a perfect  world It  would be   tremendous  that  uh  that   regime  did change  and Iran   was brought into  the the  nation. uh  the world nation   of  of  of  uh  of   organizations,  but it's just  not the case. so, they're  going to  continue  to  bless  her say that  kind of  rhetoric, but but from  our  perspective.  Let's see if   this  these attacks get them   changed their behavior. Why  are we  not striking? Iran   speaking, Of  course  about  the US? and is  that  still a  possibility Is  that   something that  could happen?  going forward?  Well, I think  that  would escalate. very   significantly and it  would  uh  escalate  to  a point  where we'd  have  to  really   recognize what  what   you know  what  that  would  mean. Um, to  strike  inside   of  Iran  the question  I  always  is  what's  the  target. Um, if  the target   is   military bases in the South  that  are launching cruise   missiles  on  American   forces. Well, that's  kind of  1 Thing.  but if  we're  going to  strike  Iran  to   get them  to  pay attention  it  means striking  downtown   Terron, it  means striking   their equivalent  of  the  Pentagon  it  means going  after their regime  and  Leadership  and so  that   that  would take  again a  significant escalation. Um,  we  don't know  what  the  reaction  would be  between  for China as  you know,  fundamentally Iran  as  a  Chinese Ally  um, and so  I  think we're holding that   back, uh  until we  find  out  more  of  the situation.  of   what  they're going to   respond to  here, but that   would start a a much  larger.  conflict  that  um, I clearly  this  Administration  doesn't  want  to  get into  that, uh,  you know  with  tip overs  is something that we  don't  know  we'd  ever  get back   in the  bottle. And I want to  talk  about another statement  that  was released  this  1  by  Hezbollah as  they   announced the suspension   quote of  military  and  security  operations  against  the occupation  forces. in   order to  prevent.   embarrassment to  the Iraqi  government. What  is  the  significance  of  that   statement?  well  I Hezbollah  maybe is  waving  a white  flag  there and that  that   group that's  um  that   organizing  their they  don't  they  know  that  um  that   the American  capability  can  hunt  them  down.  specifically  the leaders.  I  think that's  where we  will   go  after I think that's   where the next  strike  will   take  place.  We  took  out a  leader. to  Brigade  commanders  a couple  of   weeks ago as well in  in   Baghdad in  in  Iraq. Um, it   is  unfortunate that  we   don't have  a relationship   with  the Iraqi government.  that  we're working on  this   together, but but it's  just   the case  that  of  the fact   that  they're more  closely  with. Iran  right now,  so  I  think I think that's  a  message that  the leaders of   those.  uh  groups  are  sending to  the US  that   says  basically  man. Kopa we're not going to   attack  going anymore.  Uh,  and so  now maybe it's   you know  the next  play   comes from  Iran  because  Iran  has launched  cruise   missiles  in  from  Iran   into  the northern  part of  Iraq  as  they  look  at  the  Kurds as  a separatist   group.  That's  trying  to   uh  upset things  are going  on  inside  Iran, so  I think  they're trying  to  take   themselves. out of  the fight  for right now to  to  live   and fight for another day.   What  do we expect  to see   happen  with? more  strikes?   because it's  clear that  the  strikes according to  John   Kirby according to  President  Biden are not over  and  there are going to  be  more   of  them  Do we expect  those  to  happen  in the  coming?  hours days  weeks do  we   know? Josh  I think 2 things   I think the first thing we'll  look at Battle  damage   assessment  to  see if   there were  something that   we  wanted to take  out  specifically  of  the 85   targets that  we  hit and and  the and the like   their from again  from  a  military  operational  perspective.  I think that   will be 1 we  might return.  uh  with  that  we  won't  return  with  the B1   bombers.  We'll use the  assets  we  have  in  the  Middle  East. I think the  second  thing is  it's  going  after the leadership  like   I said  before  I think  that'll be  part of the  strategy. and that  that   could take  anywhere  from  a  week  to  6 months  from  now  we  did that  with   Salomon back. uh  during  the  Trump Administration. when   uh, we  said  we  would  respond uh  in  kind  and and  we  turned  around  and it   took  6 months  before  we   targeted  him inside  a  Baghdad So  when  these um   militia leaders or  Iranian  leaders decide  to  make  a  mistake,  and get outside of   Iran, then  they  become   targets we  see Israel  doing  that. They're attacking some   of  the uh, Iran   Republican guard. commanders   when  they  show  up  in   Damascus  when  they  show   up  in  Syria,  uh  to  help   the the Shia  militia groups   that are  there as well.  So   I do  think you'll  you'll   see a a military. Um, like   operational proportional   response  to  what  we  did  battle  damage  assessment   to  take  away  capability,  but then  the second  thing  is  we're going after some   of  those leaders when  they   show  their face  All right,   Mike  Lyons their retired US   Army  Major.  Thank you so   much  for taking  the time   to  join  us  here  this   morning.  in  Breakdown  a very  complicated subject.   There is  a lot to  this  and  it's  obviously not going  away  anytime soon. Anything   else  you want  to  add about  any of  this  before  I let  you go. Well, Josh  it  all  spends  on  what's  happened   inside  of  Israel  and Gaza   and uh  if  there could be   some  peace settlement   there.  uh, maybe that  would  also  uh  take  attentions   and bring them  down  a few  levels  as well.  But uh  it   continues to  be  a Tinder   Box,  uh  and until the  houthis and these this   Regional  sheet have listed  groups  of  175,000.  There's  a tremendous  number  of   them.

particular the attack that killed three of our soldiers in Jordan wounding dozens of others US military forces struck more than 85 targets at seven facilities utilized by Iran's Islamic revolutionary guard Corps and the militant groups that they sponsor three of the facilities are in Iraq four of them are in Syria numerous aircraft including B1 bombers dispatched from the United States were involved in this operation firing more than 125 Precision guided Munitions over the course of about 30 minutes Target facilities included command and control centers as well as headquarters buildings and intelligence centers rocket missile and drone storage facilities and Logistics and munition supply chain facilities these targets were carefully selected to avoid civilian casualties and based on a clear irrefutable evidence that they were connected to attack on us Personnel in the region uh the Department of Defense is in the early stages of battle damage assessment but we believe that the strikes were successful we do not know at this time if or how many militants may have been killed or wounded all US aircraft are now out of Harm's Way the president has been kept informed throughout the afternoon the United States does not seek conflict with Iran or in the broader Middle East but as President Biden has made clear we will not hesitate to defend our people and hold responsible all those who harm Americans at a time and a place of our choosing that began tonight but it will not end tonight would you not seek a conflict with Iran these targets were chosen as we said to to degrade disrupt the capabilities of the irgc and the groups that they sponsor and support as the general said we believe that the these targets uh fell into exactly that criteria um and you know the goal here is to get these attacks to stop we are not looking for a war with Iran so the signal is to the irgc and to these groups uh the attacks have got to stop um and they also not just a it's not just this wasn't just a message sending routine tonight this was about degrading capability taking away uh in a more robust way uh than uh than we have in the past taking away capabilities by the irgc and and and and the militant groups and and I want to repeat again what I said in my opening comments it these responses began tonight they're not going to end tonight um so there will be additional responses uh there will be additional action that we will take all designed uh to put an end to these attacks and to take away capability by uh by by the irgc and when you ask well why why is it how does this comport with not wanting a broader conflict because if you're taking away capability of an adversary who's trying to uh kill your troops um and in um and act uh against your interest in the region if you're trying to take away their capability then you are by default uh working to deescalate the tensions we have you know right now all of our aircraft are out of Harm's Way um I'm not going to provide any particular as it relates to timing on on future strikes our Munitions are very precise and don't take uh don't take a lack of cloud cover we can issue those or conduct those uh with good cloud cover uh in an interest of of ensuring that we're hitting all the right targets and that we're avoiding unnecessary casualties it's good for us to have clear weather to allow us to see those targets as we develop them that all came together for us as we were planning this uh the weather did turn today to allow us to to conduct these strikes um and as a result we're very confident in the targets that we that we struck today I would say and you know it's hard I'm not going to speak for the uh Iraqi or the Iranian line militia groups here but my guess is based on the fact that they they took the shot at us um and have taken multiple shots at us now that they were anticipating a response and um you know their defenses were likely to move people around uh we're pretty confident that the locations we got as Mr Kirby mentioned uh we're pretty significant in degrading uh capability and we will know better in terms of uh what that BDA looks like tomorrow I would tell you that we know that there are uh there are militants that use these locations irgc as well as uh Iranian Ali militia Group personnel who use these locations we made these strikes tonight with an idea that uh there there would likely be casualties associated with people inside those facilities um so in that sense uh it does represent a type of escalation but I do think it's a rather measured escalation um again I would caveat that uh we have not yet seen the totality of the strikes that are potentially going to be taken but thus far these are targets similar to ones that the US has targeted in the past uh after US service members have been wounded or killed uh the differen is of course uh is that we're just seeing uh more strikes and more targets it's it's really uh in some respect uh been a long observed uh practice uh that uh the US has conducted these self-defense strikes when US service members uh are wounded but especially when they're killed um but uh never really is it articulated out loud that that is the practice so uh it is interesting that in his statement President Biden did say that if you harm Americans uh we're going to come after you uh that seemingly is a public red line again uh it really was policy but now uh it's out there uh Iran and its proxies have sought to raise the temperature without actually putting the us or Israel into a corner or a significant decision point where uh we or they would have to escalate into war um in some respects uh K Hezbollah was the dog that caught the car in that they had been attacking US forces over a 100 times uh but were tragically successful with Tower 22 uh which in fact did put the US to a choice to escalate uh which is something that Iran has seemingly sought to avoid uh these last few months I think from from the US government perspective uh every day uh where the region isn't in Total War uh is a good day uh so it's very much a dayto day uh type of operation to limit hostilities to push back adversaries to address threats as they fly um but what remains to be seen is a coherent or comprehensive strategy that in fact uh seeks to arrest uh Iran's continued uh support to these proxies that continues to enable their capabilities all of the lethal intelligence uh all of the arms transfers uh so far uh there really hasn't me anything to confront or address or seek to deter Iran's role in pumping the belly s of this fire um so we'll have to see if and how US policy adapts uh to incorporate Iran's role"}, "nT6Q2LIXnoI": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT6Q2LIXnoI", "video_id":

attack killed three US troops in Northeast Jordan several days ago now these attacks are targeting positions that the US has described as belonging to militias that are backed by Iran's paramilitary revolutionary guard and its coup's Force which is its Expeditionary Unit that leazes with other militia groups in the Middle East Arms them and trains them to serve as proxy forces now we don't know exactly how many people were injured in these attacks however it does seem that the US used the b1b Lancer bomber this is a longrange bomber that likely took off from the United States it carries a lot of Munitions and can Target a lot of area now we've heard from President Biden he says that these attacks are not going to be the only ones that there could be more attacks in the future we have not yet heard from Iran however Iran in the past has warned that it will retaliate against any attack that targets its interest and all of this comes amid Israel's war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip that already raised the fears of regional escalation over that war and now with these new strikes analysts are warning that this could start a new level of escalation in The Wider region I'm John gambro with the Associated Press in Jerusalem my name is Bradley Bowman I'm senior director of the Center on Military and political power at the foundation for defense of democracies it's still early uh the initial reports are just coming in um but what we know as of right now is that US forces have struck more than 85 targets um using more than 125 Precision Munitions uh those targets are in Iraq and Syria uh and um uh uh the administration source is saying that a wide range of facilities have been hit um that includes command and control centers intelligence centers Rockets missiles unmanned AAL vehicle storage areas um Logistics ammunition supplies uh as well as they they claim some militia groups and Islamic revolutionary guard Corps sponsors who have uh been involved with or supported attacks on us and partner forces what remains to be seen one of the kind of the key unknown um variables in this moment is is it's clear that these attacks will do a lot of material damage uh to enemies of the United States to Iranian proxies Iranian funded and back proxies but how many personnel have been killed that'll be the key thing secretary Austin hinted at the Pentagon on Podium this week um you know uh you know this this may go on more than one day uh um and uh it might be a sustain sustained attack I suspect the B Administration is obviously being deliberately vague for a number of reasons including operational security and not giving too much of a warning to our adversaries but also because they want to leave their options open based on how the Iran backed militias respond I think based on early information this is a serious attack the kind of attack that only a few nations in the world could conduct um we'll have to get answers to some of the questions I've already posed some of the details that are still TBD um but I think this is the United States saying uh we have the political will and the military capability to make those who would kill our soldiers pay a very

strikes against 36 Targets in Yemen with the support of several other countries and this was in response to repeated attacks on shipping by iran-backed houis that have disrupted global trade and put lives at risk for weeks now the strikes comes today after Us's operations against Iran linked groups in Iraq and Syria in which they targeted 85 locations the Pentagon said that the strikes hit weapon storage facilities missile systems launchers and other capabilities that the houis have used to attack Red Sea shipping it added that it targeted 13 locations across the country meanwhile the UK government said that it engaged in a third wave of proportionate and targeted strikes against Iran linked houti militants in Yemen footage released by the British defense Ministry shows aircraft taking off from an Airfield identified as a cry Cyprus by the [Music] ministry the Yemen strikes are running parallel to an unfolding us campaign of military retaliation over the killing of three American soldiers in a drone strike by Iran backed militants on an outpost in Jordan on Friday the US carried out the first wave of that retaliation striking in Iraq and Syria against more than 85 targets linked to Iran's Islamic revolutionary guard core and militias that it backs the strikes reportedly killed nearly 40 people the US military's Central Command said that the strikes targeted missile sites drone storage and operation sites Radars and also helicopters Iraq had summoned a US Envoy in Bagdad after the strikes Iran has also condemned the strikes it was it was as of now unclear how tan will respond to the strikes which do not directly Target Iran but degrade groups that it backs these strikes it has now fueled fears that the war could spread to other regions in West Asia however UK defense minister Grant Sharps has denied that possibility he says that it is not an escalation and for more on the latest strikes the second round of strikes by the us we're now being joined by Edward p Joseph senior fellow at the Johns Hopkins University School of advanced international studies and foreign policy analyst and he's joining us live from Washington DC thanks very much for taking our time and joining us here on viona Good To Be With You Raa right now the next round of retaliatory strikes for the attack in Jordan has begun we've just witnessed the US and UK struck at least 30 houti Targets in Yemen now all this comes after us struck Iran backed militias in Iraq and Syria all this while us says that it does not want to escalate tensions in the region how do you read these strikes affecting the already volatile West Asia uh well uh Raa first of all the US and UK have uh tried to make it clear that these strikes in Yemen are not uh retaliatory for the uh attack in Jordan that killed three US service members so that these are separate these are part of the ongoing effort there were already two uh separate efforts by the US and British forces uh in January uh uh hitting yemeni targets that are supported by Iran uh both in terms of supply and in the presence of leadership of of senior Iranian commanders on the ground in Yemen and this represents the Third effort uh as described correctly in your report by the US and the British to uh inflict some damage and to degrade the houthi capability to disrupt shipping in the Red Sea and we should point out here that even though of course the houis retain a lot of Mobility they It's relatively easy to move drones around and continue to have these types of attacks that Iran's sponsorship is not achieving anything geopolitically there is no additional pressure on Israel to the contrary we have a half dozen countries supported the US and British in this latest effort in Yemen and that included Bahrain which could not have acted without the support of Saudi Arabia please right Mr Joseph speak of how this is the third effort by the US and UK to DET houti attacks in the Red Sea and US says that the latest strike sends a clear message to the houis that they will continue to Bear further consequences however we have seen that the previous strikes did not deter houis from attacking commercial vessels in the Red Sea rather they have rather wowed what they call uh their actions against UK and us aggressors will only increase in your opinion do you think that the latest strike will dissuade houis from attacking commercial vessels in the Red Sea well we know that uh the houthis retain the capability to move around in in small units that again they have uh support active support from Iran which ships not only the uh the weaponry and the the uh guided missiles but the computer components that are necessary for the guidance system systems and it's very difficult to to interdict that there reports even that Iran sends some of this stuff over land through through other ports besides yemeni ports so it's very difficult uh Yemen uh retains the houthis retain this ability but what they risk is they risk their uh military capabilities in a country in which they do not have complete control in which they retain uh a strong opposition within Yemen so at some point the houthis and their Iranian backers have to consider the effect on the military balance within Yemen itself and again the other thing is what does Iran and the houis achieve by this there is no additional pressure on Israel to Halt instead there are negotiations in Paris for a ceasefire the Israelis have long put forward a agreement to a plan for H release in exchange for an extended ceasefire and they continue with Egyptian and Qatari help there in Paris again no additional pressure nothing geopolitical here benefiting Iran except uh greater exposure as a destabilizing agent in the Middle East please right Mr Joseph my last question to you and coming back to Us's retaliatory strikes now seeking to avoid a regional War which which US has clearly outlined the US has not targeted Iran directly uh what is the broader message that us is trying to send here the the message is very clear that the US is determined to protect its troops in uh that are deployed in the Middle East as we say or as you say West Asia that are there primarily uh for protection against the Islamic State and and the Islamic State of course is the very organization that committed a terrorist attack in Iran killing nearly 100 Iranian civilians uh earlier last month so that is the primary reason the US Remains undeterred by these attacks and and the message is that there will be a price if these Iranian proxies continue to attack uh US forces of course the uh Biden Administration has no interest in at this point directly targeting Iran and it seems that Iran understands that and we should point out one final thing here Iran's major objective is to keep the United States out of the uh Middle East or or West Asia as you say and in fact the Hamas Mass terrorist attacks of October 7th have produced the opposite as have Iranian actions we now have uh two US aircraft carriers that are deployed in the Mediterranean we have this uh increased Naval activity British and American in the Red Sea and we have the European Union the European Union itself has deployed its own independent mission in the Red Sea so it's exactly the opposite of what Iran had hoped uh in instead of diminished Western military presence in this region there is increased military uh presence of the West in the Red Sea in particular and nothing geopolitically that is benefiting Iran please right Mr Joseph thanks very much for taking our time and joining us here on we always a pleasure to have you here you welc [Music]"}, "2p9wX1baM5M": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p9wX1baM5M", "video_id": "2p9wX1baM5M",

THE SECRETARY NEEDED TO BE CLEAR WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC, OUR PRESIDENT, AND THOSE OF US IN CONGRESS THAT HE TOOK RESPONSIBILITY FOR HAVING BEEN PERHAPS MORE PRIVATE ABOUT A DELICATE MEDICAL CONDITION AND THEN SURGERY IS APPROPRIATE GIVEN HIS ROLE AS SECRETARY OF DEFENSE. >> TURNING TO THE BORDER AND THE UKRAINE FUNDING AND THE FUNDING FOR ISRAEL THAT'S BEING HELD UP, BECAUSE IT'S ALL PACKAGED TOGETHER. SENATOR LANGFORD SAYS THE BILL IS GETTING CLOSER TO THE FINISH LINE. HE HAD THIS WARNING FOR CRITICS OF THE LEGISLATION WHO HAVE NOT EVEN READ THE BILL. THAT WOULD INCLUDE THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. >> THE BIGGEST STRUGGLE THAT EVERYBODY HAS IS NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO READ IT. EVERYONE'S GOING OFF OF INTERNET RUMORS. THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS OUT THERE THAT ARE FALSE. THERE'S THIS ONGOING THING THAT IT ALLOWS 5,000 PEOPLE IN, THERE'S NO WAY THAT'S IN THE BILL. I WOULD NEVER AGREE TO THAT. IT'S ALSO JUST A TOTAL MISCHARACTERIZATION OF THE BILL. >> NOW THERE ARE REPORTS MITCH McCONNELL MIGHT BE IN FAVOR THE TAKING THE BORDER OUT IF IT'S NOT GOING TO GET RESOLVED AND AT LEAST SEPARATING THAT OUT AND DOING THE UKRAINE FUNDING. WOULD YOU SUPPORT THAT? >> ANDREA, I SPOKE TO LITER McCONNELLMc -- LEADER McCONNELL ABOUT THAT THIS WEEK. HEPINS DETERMINED TO GET FUNDING. IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE AFTER MONTHS OF REPUBLICANS SAYING THIS DEMANDS LEGISLATIVE ACTION FOR THE REPUBLICANS THEN TO TURN AROUND AND SAY, NEVER MIND, WE DON'T NEED ANY LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION HERE, WHEN A CONSERVATIVE CHAMPION OF CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPALS ON IMMIGRATION, JAMES LANGFORD, DROVE A HARD BARGAIN AND GOT TO A POINT THAT WOULD PUT IN LAW A NUMBER OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVE CHANGES IN ASYLUM PRACTICE AND IN DEPORTATION PRACTICES WE HAVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME. I THINK IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE FOR US TO STEP AWAY FROM THIS LARGER PACKAGE. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT GETTING FUNDING TO UKRAINE, ABOUT GETTING FUNDS FOR HUMANITARIAN RELIEF INTO GAZA, INTO UKRAINE, AND FOR A DOZEN OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE NOT OFTEN MENTIONED, FROM SUDAN TO SOMALIA TO THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC TO AFGHANISTAN TO SYRIA TO MANY OTHERS ON THE EDGE OF STARVATION AND MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO ISRAEL. THIS IS A MOMENT WHEN THE SENATE SHOULD SHOW THAT WE CAN LEAD THROUGH COMPROMISE. I'M HOPEFUL THE TEXT OF THIS BILL WILL BE RELEASED SOON, TONIGHT OR TOMORROW, AND THAT AFTER SEVERAL DAYS OF REVIEWING WHAT'S ACTUALLY IN THE BILL AS OPPOSED TO WHAT'S RUMORED TO BE IN THE BILL, THERE WILL BE ENOUGH VOTES TO PASS IT IN THE SENATE. SENATOR LANGFORD IS A FRIEND. HE IS ONE OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE I HAVE EVER CALLED A FRIEND. I'M CONFIDENT THAT ONCE FOLKS SEE WHAT'S IN THIS DEAL, THEY WILL RECOGNIZE IT'S WHAT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN CALLING FOR FOR MONTHS. >> WHAT ABOUT THE HOUSE? WHAT IF IT DIES IN THE HOUSE? WOULD YOU SEPARATE OUT UKRAINE? >> THAT WOULD BE A REPEAT OF THE TRAGIC OUTCOME THE LAST TIME THAT WE IN THE SENATE DID A XROE COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION BILL. AFTER MONTHS OF WORK IT WENT TO THE HOUSE TO BE IGNORED AND DIE. IF THAT HAPPENS, THAT WILL BE A HUGE MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE BY THE HOUSE. WE SHOULD THEN TAKE UP AND PASS AID TO UKRAINE.

Houthis Launch MORE Attacks", "uploader": "The Hill", "transcript": "plans for United States strikes on Iranian personnel and facilities in Iraq and Syria have been approved in response to the Drone attack that killed three United States troops last Sunday United States defense secretary Lloyd Austin said the United States will respond to the attacks taking place in the Middle East we will have a a multi-tiered response uh and uh and again we have the ability to uh uh to respond uh a number a number of times here's more from Austin discussing the January 28th attack yesterday we believe that this was uh done by an element of what is known as the axis of resistance uh and U these are Iranian proxy groups uh and how much Iran knew or didn't know we don't know but it really doesn't matter because Iran sponsors these groups it funds these groups uh and uh in some cases it uh it trains these groups on Advanced Conventional Weapons uh and so you know I again I think without that facilitation these kind kinds of things don't happen meanwhile houie militants and Yen launched three separate attacks on the Gulf of Aiden and the Red Sea yesterday per Fox News around 5:00 a.m. us Central Command forces shot down a drone over the Gulf of Aiden and later that day centcom forces reportedly destroyed ho the explosive uncrewed surface vehicle in the Red Sea according to the United States forces the USV was heading toward the international shipping Lane that afternoon two missiles were launched from Yen toward a Liberian flagged Bermuda owned cargo ship Fox news reports so I don't know Amber when I hear about you know this unrestrained proxy group operating in the Middle East that's backed by Iran at this point we have an ally we can't call them a proxy group but it can be called a proxy war when you consider the amount of weapons the US is giving to Israel and now currently you have the administration Nan Yahoo and the like that have openly said they want the entire land to be Israel from The River To The Sea and then the United States you have the bot ad Administration saying no there needs to be a post-war Palestinian State something that Israel disagrees with not just in that sentiment from The River To The Sea they've explicitly said there cannot be a Palestinian State po War so it feels difficult to have this situation with Iran and hold Iran accountable for what the houis are doing when you have Israel not so far away uh I guess I would separate the two issues perhaps I mean I think it just depends on whether or not you actually think what Israel is doing as a genocide or war crimes as to whether or not the US would be considered quote unquote complicit but on the issue of Iran I think the the obvious uh analysis here is that Biden's strategy of appeasement has not worked he has tried since the beginning of his presidency to basically conduct a shadow Iran deal he lifted sanctions on Iran he agreed to releasing all kinds of funds that were held up um in exchange for hostages and and prisoner releases and that billions of dollars that he freed up for Iran um they claimed was only going to be used for humanitarian reasons but of course money is fungible so now they have an additional 678 billion doar that they can use to fund these militia groups and fund the manufacturing of the weapons that they're using to then kill American Service members I think it shows a a really disturbing level of weakness that it took Biden three or four days to even decide what he wanted to do in response to this um the general rule has been you don't touch American citizens you don't touch a hair on their head we now have three of them dead and we have the president waffling over what he wants to do to me this is a complete abdication of leadership I'm not advocating for war in Iran uh I think strikes if if done should be be very carefully targeted if anything if we do anything we should absolutely reimpose sanctions on Iran but to turn around and do nothing sends a very dangerous signal of weakness and unfortunately that's been sort of the tenor of the Biden presidency meanwhile United States intelligence officials have estimated that tran does not have full control over its proxy groups in the Middle East including those allegedly behind the attack and death of US troops in the recent weeks according to political officials say Tran does not appear to have complete authority over the operational decisionmaking of the cuds force in Elite branch of Iran's revolutionary guard Corps that is responsible for sending weapons to militias in Iraq and Syria and the houthis in Yemen meanwhile President Joe Biden called one of the three families who lost their child in the attack on United States troops I I know there's nothing anybody can say or do he the pain I've been there yes sir we understand man the parents overcome with emotion when the president reveals how their daughter will be honored we're promoting her postly to Sergeant oh wow that is the best news I've heard today thank you so much you don't know how much that means to us oh well I tell you what it means a lot to lot to me my son spent a year at arounda that's how I lost him and uh I uh you know 1% 1% of all these kids in the want that uh take care of 99% so at the end of our clip there Jessica you hear Joe Biden bringing up his son Bo and he does this a lot when he's talking to military families and I understand that his son served but he didn't die in Iraq he didn't come home in a flag draped coffin as he often tells people his son died years later after returning from serving of brain cancer and Biden believes that this was due to perhaps toxic fumes that he in inhaled while he was serving but it's not the same as someone being killed while on deployment and I think the fact that he keeps trying to make these people's grief his and about him is very disturbing there's been some military families who have spoken about this and are quite angry and Furious at the way that Biden talked to them about their dead children and it it's a reminder I think of the false media narrative that was pushed around uh during the campaign and and even after he won election that Biden was this so-called empath and chief that he was going to help the nation grieve the the previous four years of trump I think it's totally bogus and it's just downright bizarre that he continues to lie about the circumstances of his son's death yeah I mean there were a lot of people who served in Vietnam that came came back that later died of a agent orange would I say that if the Vietnam war never happened and they never served they wouldn't have died yeah I do I I do think that and so yes of course there's all kinds of dangerous chemicals used in the weapons that are used in combat I think just having a family member who has served there's something you can relate with the families that are grieving bonding over you know we understand the sacrifice that your family member has made we understand the feeling of sending them away knowing that they're making this potential sacrifice the ultimate sacrifice of losing their life for their country I think it it it just makes sense to bring it up and say you know I have some sense of what you're going through right now uh to console a family who's grieving I think you know to go back to you know our earlier comments on the conflict as a whole when you have a situation like this I don't think we can you know take away this conflict and judge it on its own outside of every other conflict internationally I think that's you know the one thing about every inter International conflict is that they're all irreversibly intertwined so when we think about the sanctions being removed on Iran or the United States Co cooperating with Saudi Arabia again when you know tensions between the US and Saudi Arabia tensions between the US and Iran were pretty recent we did that because of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia we did that so that the oil Market wouldn't crash as a result of sanctions against Russia we tapped a lot of our reserves and so we made some moves politically because we wanted some oil to be opened up because we cared more about Russia than we cared about Iran and Saudi Arabia at the time and so now we're in the situation where we care far more about the situation in Israel than we care about Ukraine and Russia and freeing up oil and energy prices in Europe and so now we're probably happy to sanction Iran again uh just to make a point about the houthis attacks on shipping and about what's going on with Israel and tensions in the region and so I really think all of these conflicts are intertwined in a complicated ated way because the United States doesn't relate to other countries with any consistent moral code whatever is most pressing in that moment in time to protect us interests which oftentimes compromises us interests in the long term so I think you know if if we're upset about what's going on with the houis the solution is not to strike back at Iran I think the solution is to realize that we're sending weapons to a leader who is not doing something that's aligned with the administration's strategy or interest in the region we've explicit said it's not so I think the way forward rather than sending troops and putting them at risk in the Middle East the solution would be to pull back weapons and wait and see what the outcome of the ultimate icj ruling is after the subsequent analysis of Israel's actions are they actually committing a genocide they were worried about that and there's going to be followup about that I think it's time for the US to pull back that would be the smart move diplomatically and would be in the best interest of the working people across the country that go on and lay their lives on the line to serve the country yeah we're about out of time I would just close with the fact that my issue with Joe Biden bringing up B is not that he's trying to relate to the people who are grieving but that he lies about the circumstances of his son's death and makes their grief about him and I'm just speaking from experience when you are in the midst of of immense grief the last thing you want to hear is I know how you feel we'll be back with more Rising after

I want to talk   about all of  this  as  again  there are a lot of   Development. So,  let's bring  in  Howard  Stouffer,  professor of  National   Security. at the   University of New Haven to   break it  all down. Howard.  Thank you again for taking   the time  to be.  Here   You have  joined  us  several  times over the  past, several  days  when  we  really   appreciate it.  Thank you  for having  me. So  first off  the tough question  here   that  we  the the most  is,  can you break down  how we   did get to  this  point right  here? well, you know  Israel   and Hamas.  have had   conflicts  there have been times when   they had gotten so  intense.   as in 22. 2014. the Israelis   went  in. for 54  days. and  tried to suppress the rocket   fire  and the Kumasi   leadership  that  were   organizing  it.  there been additional times  in  2018. 2020, one 2022  and  and now,  you know, with   this  terrible  attack, that   had been  planned and  had been planned in a way  that  they're very  little   has happened  since 2021 to  give  these rallies the  impression  that  maybe  they're making  some  some   progress  in trying to  reach  some  kind  of  under the  understanding.  with  with   kamaz.  Come on.  totally  rejects The idea  of  Israel.  there can be  no  Israel   from  the sea to  the Jordan   River.  They   want they believe all of   Israel  is  Territory.  So,  when you  have  an  enemy  that  that  feels that  way  and it  will  do  anything.  to  get back  at  the  Israelis. They've been   fighting  now.  for a very   long time since the since  that period,  in  2005, And,   you know, we  all know  the  attack  on  Israel  killed   1300  Israelis,  It was planned  executed.  complex attack  plan  by   not only come on,  Kill 1300 Israelis. There was planned and executed complex attack planned by. Not only from Oz, but probably with her Iranian.  help. leaders  in the  u.s.a., they have no   heart.  intelligence. That   Iran  was involved  but  everybody in  Israel   believes  and everything   the Israeli military  believe  that  Iran  obviously gave   them  a great deal  of  help   and assistance  in planning,   this  very  complicated  attack. So now, Israel  has  gathered  300,000 troops   Called  up. 360,000 Reserves.  and they  pulled  all of   their hard, you know, tanks.   and bulldozers  and  everything  else  that's   needed  for  a ground incursion. into   Gaza  on  top of  the  strikes over. 6,000 just  on   as  a Friday. I don't know   know how many as  of  today  many  have  been, fired upon   various parts of  Gaza   mainly  North and Gaza and   the Gaza City area. We   talked  about this  a bit  earlier,  but Rockets were   launched  this  morning from   Lebanon into  Israeli  territory.  is  that   Hezbollah and  has since become  an   everyday  occurrence   over the  last  week  Is   this  something new?  Can you  break that  down  for me?  Well, you know, in  2006.  that had been skirmishes   whereas really  IDF members  had been  taken and into   into. Northern  into   Southern  Lebanon and  you know, there were   taking them as hostages.   Ages  in   the Israeli military  didn't.  fought back and would not  accept  that  outcome.  And  so  as  a result  it  was a  majors  and scale of   fighting  in  2006  that   ultimately  led to   vast destruction. in   southern  Lebanon,  The  Israelis  got up  to  West   Beirut. And you know, also   caused  tremendous  damage   to  Lebanese, infrastructure   and the City  of  Beirut.  the Lebanese  of  not really   recovered from  that  since  2006. And now there  have been,  you know, these  exchanges of  Ron Tillery  Rocket  fire. and  mortar fire.  and suppose  The Lebanese  Are,  you know,  gearing up. Probably. to open  up  a second  front and we   should  have  discussed what   the Iranian foreign minister.  has been  saying  despite the  fact that the Lebanese   foreign minister  on   Monday, said  that  he  does   not want  have  a war with   Israel. but I think events   are out of  his control.  and  it's really up to the  really up Hezbollah on, which  has  a hundred thousand Fighters  and thousands of  rockets.   ready to  fight Israel. This   is  this  would be  a major  And we  know  that   Israeli troops  are set up   at  the Gaza  border  for an   offensive by  ground.  air and sea.  what  is   something like  that. look   like  and is  that  likely   to happen soon? well,  you know   He's out of Northern Gaza and have them moved to Southern Gaza, so they're giving them more more time to do that. And that's, that's  one element  of  all these preparations.  when  the accursed  accursed   will  be  the choice  made   by  the IDF and the political  leadership  of  Israel.  Meanwhile,  the United   States  is  sending a second   carrier group as  the first  Carrier Group by  the general  dog Ford. aircraft  carrier.   is  already on  station  and off the coast of  Israel.  A second  one  one is coming the Dwight   Eisenhower. with  all of  its  cruise cruise ship  mr. Ships  that  carry cruise  missiles   and and destroyers, that   carry missiles. Meanwhile,   the United  States  has been   augmenting. Its its aircraft   in  the entire  region.  a tense, the  Hogwarts  which  are used  for fighting  on   the supporting  fighting  on   the ground. of being   sent into the region  as  our  f-35s f-15s f-18s f-16s.  So,  are the States is building   quite an air Armada.  in  the  event.  It  won't fight the  war for Israel. but if  other  actors  begin to  expand  the  war,  especially  if   Hezbollah starts firing.   its tens  of  thousands of   rockets into  Northern   Israel. Israel  is prepared  to  strike  back  but if   there are additional  attacks  if  Iran itself gets   involved   and the United States will,  obviously the president  will have to  make  a  decision  on  what  we  do.  And we  will  be  prepared   militarily  to  do  it. As  I  mentioned,  a lot of   developments  coming  in   over  the last, several  hours.  past, 24 hours,  or so,  Israeli Defense  Forces  did tweet out  Ally Condie led Forces   inhumane  barbaric? October  7th Massacre  of  civilians  in  Israel. We  have   eliminated. him.  Is  that  a  significant death?  What  do   we  know  if  anything  about  this  person? that  they   tweeted about Because a  lot of  folks out there,   were  messaging us  and  thought maybe he's  the  leader  of  Hamas overall And  now he's  been  eliminated.  That's  obviously not the  case. So  can you break down?  what  we know.  Well.  he's pretty much  a shadowy  figure. he's  one of   the several.  individuals  that  have  been  named as   the planners  for these  attacks that  occurred  on   Israel. And you know, I guess  the Israelis  are able  to   confirm that  they  know   where he was  and they   destroyed the building  or   house that  he  was in. the  last  24 hours  There are  obviously other Hamas  leaders.  they  are to go  after I mean, one of the   objectives  of  an  Israeli  incursion would be  to take  out the Hamas leadership. and  to  take  out their military.  capability. which raises  the  whole question  about the  tunnel  Warfare.  That  is   another huge  problem.  that   arises  because the Israelis   were  taught  by  surprise.  in  2014, they  went  into   Gaza  And then, all of   a sudden, there were these   were literally   kilometers of tunnels  we're Fighters   were coming out and,   you know, attacking Them. And  then going back into  these  tunnels.  Israelis  were  not  prepared  to  fight in   the tunnels.  Now,  they know  that  they've mapped  out  many of these days  tunnels  are not just  short distances  these were talking  about  dozens  and dozens  of   kilometers  of  tunnels.   that  billions  of  dollars  that  have been given to   the from  us over the years,   mainly  by  guitar  and other  and other countries that   were  trying  to  give  them   a humanitarian  Aid.   when money was  mainly by,   Option explosives. And there are special forces in the Israeli military that arelike, they're called  tunnel rats  or  how long one. they   know how to go  into  these  tunnels and work  their way  through them. and  cleaned up fights.  against  the enemy in  these tunnels.   but it's  not an easy  operation.   That's going to cause a lot  of  casualties. and  it's going  to  be  very   tough because you know,  they come  awesome filter command and control.structures.  underneath  their hospitals,   particularly  the main   hospital  in  Gaza, which did  not shut down is  Still  treating  thousands of   people. They  have  a  command-and-control center underneaththat. the hospital.  So  the Warfare is  going  to be very  complex.   I already the Israelis have  already said. that   they've already sent  in.  a reconnaissance. units.  to   take  a look  at  where  they're going to go.   I'm sure   they will also send in   Special Forces. that  are  looking for the hostages.  and they're also   And they're also probably planning, like they're not going to  fight  Street by Street  house  by house, that  would be  a  losing  proposition.  for  Israel. They're going to   have  a specific   group that they're  going to   take. and they're trying to  map out what  that   word should be. and it  may  very well.  if  an area is   free  or  mobile  only   mainly  free of civilians  than  they  may take,  you know, particular Street  and go  through that   knowing if their tongue  those there as  well. So   we're talking about highly   complicated.  ground   incursion.  or from the air.   I'm sure   there will be plenty  of  air  cover.  or  the troops  that   would go in.  from the sea   there,  probably  will  be,  you know, ships,  Most   chips.  that  will  land  on   the coast and move  inland.  as  well. and it looks  like   the Israelis  looks target.  In the South but not in the North. If they're in the north, they've been one that they need to move and get out as they can.So  we're talking  about the complexity  of   2023  Warfare.  in  an urban   environment.  that's   fairly hostile. All right,   Howard. Stouffer's  always,  thank you so  much  for  taking  the time  to  join   us  and help  break down   this  subject.  We  know.  there is  a lot to  this. so   it's  very  easy  for  somebody  to  miss   something.  So  I'm glad   that  you're able to  come   on  here  and help  kind of  catch people  Up  Is  there  anything  else  that  you  want to talk  about here   before  I let you go? Because  again,  so  many   developments  coming  in,  pretty  much  on  an  hourly   basis.  Well,  I will only say that  I  Secretary of State  Anthony  blinken.  has been  all over   the region. he's been  situated. The Saudi Arabia.  He's  back  in. Tel Aviv   tonight in  there might be   understandings  that   can be worked out with   Egypt.  He's  been  in Egypt,  of course.  and I think,   you know I'm  diplomatic   efforts are going to  be   going in  parallel. with   this  railly. efforts.  and I  am  sure  that  our military   and their abilities. Are you   going to be working out?   ways  to  coat each other.   So  that  our planes  and  airplanes and far planes, get  involved  because the war  expands both  through  Lebanon.  and the border   with  Israel  and possibly   in Syria, And the border with  Israel  and they go on and   even  beyond  that. if   missiles not getting  fired  from. from  Iran itself.  we   need  to  have  ways  to   disengage and make sure that   we  don't,  you know   how long each other's  aircraft. like we do   in NATO, are  there certain  code sent to  each  other.   So  they miss their princes friendly.friendly and  is   and is  part of it.  integrated  plan. So   that's just a lot just  going  on. We have to wait and see  you.  see how this  develops?  That is very  true.

We  want  to  get you  up  to  speed on  all the  developments. that  happened   today in  the Israeli Hamas  conflict  there.  We  have  a  live  picture there.  This   is  an Ashkelon.  Israel   looking into  Gaza  at  the  moment  this  comes as   Secretary of State  today.   Antony blinken   They're meeting with   prime minister   Bibi Netanyahu. we  also   have  this  pretty   bombshell.  report  in   Politico  today as  well   political reporting us   officials.  have  asked the  Israeli military. to  explain  its air strike  on a  densely  populated.  refugee camp  in   Gaza. this  week  and this   all dovetails  is well with the  major  speech  given today.   They're in  Lebanon by  the  leader  of  Hezbollah  a terrorist group there.  in   the too.  Reels  North let's talk  about  all of  this  right now with   our friend  freelance  journalist. Zach  Andrews  standing  by  for us  live   in  Tel Aviv  with  the  latest  that good to  see you  so  you've really been   tracking  all of  those  stories that  I just   mentioned today including  this  dress given today by   Hezbollah leader. Hassan.  Nasrallah.  What  was his  message today?  Well, I  can tell you  how the message  was received. in  throughout   the Arab world. This  was a  highly. anticipated.  Speech.  because the precursor to   this  this  moment  today was  that  Hezbollah?  a army  of   over  100,000 was on  the  northern border with  Israel.  saber-rattling  potentially  involving themselves. in   this  fight,  but today it   was a very  subdued as   if you could  I'd say so  a  subdued tone. from  the  Hezbollah leader  because  from  indirectly  claims that  this  is  a war with  Israel,  but did not sign. any sort of  specific. strategy. forward.   rather than saying  that   Hamas.  must  win this  war  and that  Hamas was on  a  righteous path. to  Victory,   but not saying  that   Hezbollah itself   would involve themselves. in   the fight.  It  was also   also curious. us to note   that  he  specifically   pointed out that  Hamas  carried this  attack  out  without their knowledge He   gained  went  to   Great Lengths to  point this   out in an hours-long. long   speech. that  did not really   signify anything. in.  specific. as  to  what  would  happen  next. for Hezbollah.   He  did call  out the  Americans and pointed to  the  US. carrier groups   the region. and and made  it   very  clear.  that. America  was also  to  blame that the   United States was at  fault  for what  was happening here.  but again did not  specifically  said  Hezbollah  would involve themselves. in   this  fight.  a very  tense  moment  in the  north. You   see some of the images  from   my  friend. freelancer  in   Beirut. Hunter  Williamson.  he  was able  to  attend   this  event there was  thousands of  supporters.  many  watching  the  live stream on. television   throughout  the area. some   of  the folks in that area.  did.  Express their  discontent  their their  frustration that  the Hassan   nasrallah did not take  a  bigger  Leap  Forward and  declare a broader war in   this  region, but for now  Israeli sources.  are very   pleased with  the result   of this speech  They  feel   like  the deterrence   They've laid  out over the   past  now,  now 29 days of   this  war was effective and  that  they  were  able  to   for the most  part. deter.   hezbollah's involvement.   Yeah, I mean sex is so   interesting.  So   let's scroll is speech. He   said  this  quote some  say  I'm going to  announce  that   we have entered the battle.  He  went on to  say we've  already entered the battle   on  October 8th.  He   argue that   hezbollah's cross-border   strikes.  have  pulled  away.  Israeli forces  that  would  otherwise be  focused on   Hamas in  Gaza, but it seems   Hamas doesn't feel  that   way.  I mean  I was stopped  short of  going like  you  said. full-scale  into  the  war effort  being led by   Hamas and that  led to  your   point a lot of   disappointment  there and  nasralla. doing this  by   video He's  notoriously a  recluse is  that  because he   fears for his safety  when   he  goes  out in public.   public. It's great  question.  in  this  particular. space.   There's any leader  that  is   involved  in  any of  these  organizations?  They  are  reclusive,  right?  Because  they  are hiding  from  the  potential Israeli.  forces   that  obviously our have   have  pointed as  these  leaders is  being leaders of   terrorist organizations.  and  that  should  they  make   appearances in  public  that   would be  something that   would catch the Israelis.  I obviously SLI this  speech   taking  place.  remotely   with  the thousands of   viewers.  It's  hard  to  say  exactly.  what  the the  strategy  or  the path   forward for.  Hezbollah is   when  they  know  they have a  massive Target  on  their  back  into your earlier  point.  the these skirmishes   in  any other situation.  if   this  was happening a month  two months  ago before  the  Hamas attack  the amount of  fighting  that  has taken  place on the  northern   border  with  Lebanon.  would  would capture the  world's attention as  a major  conflict. but because of   what's  happening in  the  Gaza  Strip,  with  limited  casualties. ranging in the   dozens. in  the north. This  is  not been  considered  a  full-blown. escalation now   Hezbollah again.  has upwards  of   a hundred thousand Fighters.   So  a full  escalation   conflict  in the  north  would look. at  much greater   scale than  what we  have seen.  so  for a some   sort of formal.  declaration of  war to  not  be  followed  by  large  engagements in  the north is   something that's  obviously  being used  or  being pointed  as  major precursor for  something larger. but right  now it  has been  focused on   Gaza  that  the amount  of   fighting  in  the Gaza Strip   has been  intense.  and to   the north It  has been  very   limited.  Yeah. No, that's   a great Point Zach  as  well.  And I was kind of curious and  we're going to  ask some of  our experts who were going   to come on  right after  we're done  speaking  with   you.  You know, why this   speech  and why now,  I'm  kind of curious there but to   your point, let's get into   was happening on the ground  there.  in  Gaza  There's  been a lot  of  reports to   today and we're going to   talk  about them  with  you.   that. Israel. struck  an   ambulance in  Gaza  City   today that  it said was  carrying  militants.  But  which health  authorities  there in  the  hamas-controlled? Enclave  said  was?  evacuating   wounded people  from  the  besieged  north to  the south  of  the territory.  I want   to put  up  this  tweet here   This  is  from  Jonathan   Cahn  Rica's  a spokesman  with  the IDF.  We  spoke to   him live  yesterday.  He   tweeted this. Zach. He  said   Hamas has a long  record  of   abusing.  dances in Gaza  to   move  combatants  commanders   and weapons.  by  doing so   they're violating  international law.  when  we   perceive  in.  immediate threat  were  well   within  our rights  to   strike  as  they  have   relinquished. special.   protection, So  this  is   getting a lot of  attention  today.  What more do we know   about this  particular?  strike  on  this  ambulance  there in  Gaza? Well, if  you  start with  this, it's  again  the al-shifa  hospital  which  encountered that  blast about  Week week and a half  ago  that  captures  the world's  attention the explosion in   the parking lot and the  rapid.  controversy  surrounding.  who fired which  missile and where it came  from. this  ambulance.  was  according to  the red  crescent  society,  which  operates  some of these  ambulances  that  were   transporting. vehicles   to the  South they  initially  came  out and said  that   none  of  their staff with   the ambulance was injured  about now.  An hour ago they   have  now said  that   there actually were injuries,  but that  did correlate with   what  the IDF was.  telling  all of  us, which was that   there were  militants.   inside  the ambulances and   that  was what  they  struck.  the red crescent  said  that   they  were  traveling  southbound  now.  I should   back  up  for a moment  and  say that  Gaza  City  now as   of  yesterday.  has been   fully encircled the iaf has  told us that  they  have   forces  all along the South  and they  have  encircled  from the  north as  well.  So this is  a isolated  City.  They  have  cut it  off.   from  both  points  And then   the coastal road  that  runs   down  the Mediterranean was  basically blocked the  red crescent  saying  that   the the facilities  are the  ambulances  that  they  were   trying  to  take  South were   blocked by  rubble  and  debris  in  the road. So   they  decided to  turn   around  they were trying to  take  wounded to The   rafah crossing  they  said   were  A mile  a sorry  a kilometer away. from  the  hospital when they  say they   encountered a missile strike   the damage  to the vehicles  and they  were able to   continue  and then  a second   strike  taking  place  meters away from  the gate   to the  hospital  they  say  now independent.  reports.   are confirming that there are  leat at least a dozen over  a  dozen fatalities. in  the  strike  on  the ambulances.  We  have  not been  able  to   independently confirm the  occupants of   of the ambulances if  they   were  in  fact  militants,   but it  does  signal  to  the  rest  of  the world that  the  Israelis  are willing to   strike. What  would normally   be? in  fact  would in   all scenarios are see that   civilian? infrastructure? and  the rules of  Engagement  in   conflicts?  all across  the  world.  do  require extreme  diligence and care. when   involving.  civilian   infrastructure. and when   civilians are  in the line of fire.  fire   the IDF will  tell  you well   they  have  told. the people   of  Gaza  City  to  evacuate   to the  South that  there  would be  strikes.   regardless. in  the north  and that  they  were  going  to  consider. targets  that are  hiding  behind.  civilian  infrastructure.  They  keep  reminding us.  that  the tunnels and the  infrastructure  for Hamas are  located under hospitals under  schools under civilian   buildings.  that  those  targets are what  they're  considering.  fair game.   Now that  does not   change the  reality for the  people  that  were  involved   in  this  strike  that   were nearby.  the  hospitals are the only   point of  Refuge for   civilians if  you live  in   Gaza  City, it's one  of the   only  places  that  you can  get reliable  power.  It's   where a lot of  the  journalists go  to  charge   their camera so they  can  show  the so  what   is happening? to  Gaza  City   and the Gaza Strip  currently  that  ambulance will  again  we  have  confirmed of  over   a dozen.  fatalities. but no   confirmation  as  to  the  identity  of  who those  people  were. if  they   were in fact  Hamas.   militants.  All right,   you know  exact will be  talking about this   a little bit  later on  this   hour, but lastly  though, I  know  you're in Tel Aviv.  that's  you know  further  north than  you have  been   you bend down.  out there in   Ashkelon  and stir  Road   near  the Gaza  border. and  so  from  a personal.  standpoint  you have  been   there now almost  a full   month since this  all began.   what's  going on  there  in Tel Aviv?  are there still  rocket  attacks that  far?   north into  Central Israel   And what  will  you be   looking for going into  the  weekends from a personal   standpoint  as  journalists  there?  on the  ground  now  almost  a month into  this   war?  Well, there were   a rocket  attacks again today  on  Central Israel.  remarkable  fact  when   you're  considering.  that   the number of strikes and the  amount of force.  targeting  these locations that  do   fire  Rockets from  the Gaza   Strip The IDF says  that   they are  taking  these  locations as out  But still  they  have  the capacity   Hamas has the capacity. to   strike  deep. into  Central  Israel  the Iron Dome.   intercepts  them. It's a   consistent. between these two  very  close Regional   launches  of the  Hamas  Rockets from  the strip into   Central Israel   their intercepted overhead   that  was happening again  today as  for what   we're looking for.  going  into  the weekend and the  next  week  ahead.  secretary  blinken.  arrived today and  had several.  high-level   meetings  it  was quite  curious to see  him.  also   meet  with  the opposition   party member  here  in   Israel. and that  is   something that  is  signaling  to  a lot of  spaces  that   the United States?  is?  trying. to  push  this  in   the last  few days  at least.  this  attempt at  a pause.   at a ceasefire  now the  current prime minister.  netanyahu's saying  that  is   not going to  happen  unless   there are any there's any  movement. on  releasing  hostages  and that  there  will be no  ceasefire until  the hostages. are released.  the B Administration calling.  for a pause instead of   humanitarian pause  the  Netanyahu Administration   saying  well  that  will only  give  time  to  our enemy to   re-equip  to  refuel  and to   prepare.  for the continued  battle. that  will  certainly  last  four. many  more  weeks  inside. Gaza. now.  blinken  secretary blinken leaving  today.  and one of  that   last  his last  meetings  was  with  the opposition  party  member. the former   prime minister. before net.  Ah who was  re-elected. last   year, I think that  a lot of   people  forget the   intensity of  what's   happened  in. Israel's   democracy.  in the  last   year. Netanyahu has been   indicted  for bribery and  Corruption. and then  he  won  re-election.  And for the  past  year  there have been  massive.  protests  massive.   demonstrations. in the   streets of  Tel Aviv  of   Jerusalem.  for his proposed   changes to  Israel's   judicial  system. So  it's   very  remarkable  to see  see  a u.s.  Biden.   Administration  official   meeting with  the former   prime minister and  the  opposition. party during  a  time  like  this. some  see  it  as  potentially.   undermining the current.   Administration  and the  ability to  wage  war.  going  forward others  see it  as   the u.s. Hedging  their bets.  and participating again  in this political dance.   where we  don't know  what   happens next. and neither  does  the administration   right?  And that's  another  question  we have will  the  Netanyahu government will his  coalition survive this  war  when  all is said and done   to  your  point blinking   meeting with  been against   today as  well  as   Netanyahu?  Yes.  they  have   entered into  this. emergency  Unity government, you know   to  better  tackle  the war  at hand so  that's  something  we'll have  to  look  out for  as  well  amid all  the  internal  domestic. politics   there in  Israel. Zach   Andrews.  We  really   appreciate  reporting and  we'll talk  again soon.  Thanks  so much.   Thank you, Andrew.  I choose   X point.  We're going to  be   bringing on some  experts  at the  bottom  of the  hour   to kind of dive  in a little deeper.  to some of  Zach's   reporting.  But remember   all week. I've been asking   some  of  our  National Security Experts  to help me. with  the hairs  here  between these two  words.  pause.  and  cease fire. Are they  just  a  distinction without  a difference? Well, this is  Lincoln's line  today.  from   Lucas is  saying  blinken and  Tel Aviv  that  a  humanitarian  pause.  could  help  get.  hostages  back.  So  it  seems somewhat  like   blinken is  on  board with   what  president.  Biden and  National Security Council  spokesman.  John  Kirby.  has  been  saying  throughout  the  course  of  the last  four   or five days. will, but to   that. we  also  heard.  from   Bibi Netanyahu. today.   and he  was quite vehement.  saying  that. there is  not  going to  be  any type of  ceasefire soon  Lucas  Tomlinson tweeting  this   out.  saying  following the  meeting with the  US   Secretary of  State.

there've been all kinds of uh you know shuttle diplomacy going on over the last couple of days and and rightly so I think the the lead has been taken by the United States kind of use their Network in the region to kind of make sure that this conflict in Gaza remains fairly locally uh focused on on Gaza and doesn't spill over into other parts of of the region and obviously the greatest concern everyone is having is Hezbollah Iran at the same time also very concerned that if Hezbollah got into involved into this kind of conflict that everything could spill out of control and drag Iran into a conflict that Iran doesn't want uh and also it kind of raises the concern of many of these non-state actors including Hamas are self-sufficient entities their networks in themselves they have a great degree of agency and also autonomy to do what they think is necessary uh and it shows that the Iranians through their proxy and surrogate Network might expose themselves to risk of getting dragged into a conflict considering also that the US are really uh increasing their sort of deterrence posture in the region so all of this is going on at the same time nobody wants this to escalate but then again all parties also have certain R lines that they can and cannot accept you know Andreas with each day we're reading stories in the international press about just how well prepared this Hamas attack was uh with a huge Arsenal uh knowing where to go uh knowing who to Target there was and this coming after that initial report by the Wall Street Journal that there had been uh a coordination uh with Hezbollah and that had even been a meeting in Beirut the Monday before the attack uh your thoughts on uh how Hamas pulled off something so ambitious right I mean this is certainly not something that they came up with impulsively over the weekend and then decided to execute it I mean that's been in the planning for months some say as long as years certainly there's been all kinds of support and coordination with external forces and obviously Hamas is part of a network of not of anti-israel or anti-israel Allied non-state actors in the region and hasb is certainly one of their main Partners here and heah has been somewhat a hub in the Iranian Network to kind of uh help other non-state actors to operate on behalf of Iran they've done that in the with the hudis in Yemen as well so Hamas certainly had some coordination going on I I I what I have a problem with is this article in the Wall Street Journal which is based on some you know very um you know tentative sort of um tentative um and and also for the most part Anonymous sources and we don't really know if that's actually true and then we've seen that the International Community including the Israelis have spoken out against it saying actually it wasn't true we don't think Iran had a hand in it well let me ask you the question differently then Andreas uh could Hamas have carried this out without speaking with Iran yes they could have done that um but I do think we we what we do know however is that Hamas operatives have been trained outside of Raza and have have have come back in and that if that training had actually taken place in Lebanon which is very likely then it would have done been done under the direction of hasbalah and potentially also with the knowledge of uh Iranian intermediaries from the ks fors or the Revolutionary guards but the actual execution of it the timing of it and the planning of it was done locally within uh the Gaza Strip and I think Iran for the most part was really taken by surprise I think Hamas was taken the political leadership was taken by surprise what how it was executed how deep they were able to penetrate and the the amount of atrocities that they were able to commit very briefly one Andreas cig you talk about the civilian leadership taken by surprise we saw the Iranian foreign minister in Doha Sunday sitting down with hamas's Exile leader ismile Han what are the optics for the hosts uh for the of that venue uh Qatar which has both strong relations with Iran and with the West well Qatar has positioned itself after the Arab Spring as a a mediator uh and a hub for basically building networks connecting different actors that would not be able to meet directly I mean they've been negotiating with the Taliban for years they've been hosting the Taliban and Hamas upon request of the United States to kind of build that relationship and both Israel and the US have benefited from that relationship and continued to benefit K's been playing intermediary role and kind of getting hostages out they're playing an intermediary role between Ukraine and and Russia to get hostages free there and a lot was announced this morning they're taking a role together with Egypt trying to to build up a a humanitarian Corridor uh and lastly they're playing a role with Iran as well not only in terms of uh getting hostages relieved from Iran a couple of weeks ago but also making sure that Iran is not going to escalate because none of the states in the Arab world or the wider Middle East have any IDE any interest in escalation and again the US requires that sort of intermediary function that the countries are providing and they're quite happy that the countries are providing this and I think it has been M represented in the media as being some sort of uh politically aligned or ideologically aligned sort of partnership for the countries it's very pragmatist makes them very uh uh very relevant in the region and it kind of gives them an outsized role uh to broker deals that nobody else can broker and that's basically why it's happening Andre C many thanks for joining us from London again if you're just joining us here on France 24 uh"},

between Lebanon and Israel that brings the total kills to 11 in the past 48 Hours alone earlier the Israeli military said it attacked Hezbollah forces planning to launch missiles and Rockets toward Israel the two sides have been exchanging fire across the border since Hamas attacked Southern Israel on October the 7th well the fighting has forced thousands of people from their homes in Lebanon sahod reports from a school Sheltering displaced people in the southern city of T people are complaining we are talking about thousands of people who are now displaced as you can see behind me they spend the day at at the school's Courtyard these people live in villages close to the border which really is now a war zone approximately 100 kilomet of the Israeli Lebanon border is now a military area and fighting and shelling really confined to a depth of at least 2 km so people in that region have made their way deeper inside Lebanese territory local officials that we've been speaking to here have been telling us they're struggling they just don't have the budget to deal with this crisis and it's still not a crisis because there hasn't been a mass Exodus and the fighting is still relatively confined in geographical terms beds blankets because winter is approaching they don't have that we have to remember Lebanon State the government is nearly bankrupt there is a a deep financial and economic crisis in this country now in its fourth year people too are struggling to make ends meet uh they their unemployment is high so these are the people who have nowhere else to go other people have relatives in other cities across the country they're staying at at their homes others who do have money are renting homes but more and more people are making their way from the south as they fear this conflict could widen well let's bring in t kud he's a professor of public policy at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies thanks again for joining us here in the studio just in regards to hisbah there that Zena was talking about how do you see things playing out there in southern Lebanon if things escalate further within Gaza will it be inevitable that hisbah and Israel I guess expands the conflict uh than what we've seen over the last few days Tom this is an excellent question and the answer is yes there is a high possibility this could escalate into a fullscale war involving hisbah what hasb is doing now is more or less it's a calculated response so they have set some lines red lines for Israel which is which includes the invasion of Gaza the land invasion of Gaza so if Israeli forces go inside Gaza then hisbah will uh escalate M now uh to be honest it's I again the the the entire question of a full War also is whether hasbalah will be fully engaged in this in this uh in this war it remains a difficult one to answer because hisbah also is in a very difficult position I mean internally inside Lebanon Lebanon is a very fragile country uh it has many difficult social economic situations many people inside liberal also blame hisbah for the misery Lebanon also is is is facing now sanctions in Lebanon because ofb Allah's involvement with as well so it's it's also between two fires the internal uh the internal pressure from many segments of the Lebanese Society not to be involved in a war with Israel fearing the vast destruction and at the same time it's it's more or less it's its reputation and its U its legitimacy as a resistance party in Lebanon which has been always at the Forefront of uh of of of of resisting Israel you know liberating Southern uh Lebanon so it's it's he hasb is not an easy position but but the important factor here is to watch Iran what is the Iranian decision I mean will the Iranian the the Iran's support the full war with with with Israel or they have their own different calculations so it's it's it's a it's a snowball it's it's a rolling snowball we don't know how will it uh where will it stop and how will it end more or less so yeah I guess it is one of those things we we wait and see we're also just getting uh more information in that hamas's armed Wing the AL kasan Brigade say they've launched two suicide two suicide drone attacks one of which targeted a squadron of the Israeli Air Force located at one of their bases a second drones targeted the headquarters of the saai division of the Israeli Army located at the Israeli teslam military base how big a deal is that two uh suicide drone attacks launched in in the last half an hour or so that from what we understand I'm not familiar with the term suicide drone attacks I know drones are all drones so like in Russia they used in Ukraine same like using Gaza but in anyway I mean this this is more or less an indication that Hamas has capability capabilities fighting capabilities and it's sending a message that uh it's it's it's ready it's still it's still uh it's still military capable of responding correct and and tactically not even so basically now what's happening is that you would think or the Israeli Society or the Israeli government would think that the war is fully concentrated on Gaza and inside Gaza yes and then you suddenly hit Hamas hits and say no it's not over we still have the rockets and then we have tactical weapons that we can use to hit Israeli military targets inside Israel but again these are I mean when it comes to scale it's nothing to compare Hamas whatever Hamas has I mean these are primitive weapons in the weapons industry and technology in comparison into what Israel has Israel has devastating capabilities to wipe out Gaza and Hamas is again it's it's a part is a gorilla fights gorilla Warfare tactics so it's uh we we we need to be aware of the comparisons and the scale also of course yeah thank you so much T we really do appreciate your input again thank you so much"}, "ZGV8Hglsnfk": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGV8Hglsnfk", "video_id": "ZGV8Hglsnfk",

with the Wilson Cent's Middle East program thank you very much indeed for joining us um we've got this news that Aid should start entering Gaza tomorrow would you say that's the most significant achievement that was made during the visit to the region by the US President Joe Biden I mean I wouldn't describe it as an achievement I mean this is the minimal of of of the role of of flow somehow that that allow some uh humanitarian Aid that's a large population in Gaza that's not necessarily linked to directly linked to uh uh to Hamas it's been now we 12 days since um this round of conflict started um there's no clear uh road map of how things going to go the next uh 24 hours looks crucial in that sense not only in Gaza but for the region so uh U yeah I mean Egypt is a key border because the other crossing point with Israel is obviously not feasible now uh so there's lot of Medical Aid needed food basic food so I think it's uh the International Community should be pushing out that objective regardless of of B's visit okay but apart from achieving this and getting the the gates of the Rafa border crossing open we hope tomorrow we think tomorrow what else did President Biden achieve by visiting the region yesterday I mean the visit itself was uh relatively short uh I mean he spent time on the plane on Air Force One to get to Israel more than he spent on the ground so for for him it was necessarily to to show this uh just this support uh the preparation for the visit was uh in the days and the weeks before that uh I think there was two achievement uh uh quote unquote first that uh there was little bit of of delay of ground Invasion at least for a few days it might happen now in the next uh days but at least it was not imminent in the last period and the second goal was for him to achieve little bit of the escalation of the conflict but now he left Israel we are facing a new real in reality that an invasion might happen in the next days as Israeli are are are hinting and we have new Regional escalation with Iran uh and their allies uh heading little bit at uh us Targets in uh whether through Yemen or through Iraq uh so the the objective of the visit immediately has been casted out on after after this uh I I thought he should have gone there with the clear plan to end the violence he just went for uh not very clear objective and now we're seeing that the region is going into more uh escalation so I think there's a need for more us effort uh of the terrorist and of mediation uh to basically calm down the tension in the region okay I mean if if Joe Biden didn't manage to achieve that while he was there himself which allies in the region can the United States count on to help try to deescalate and try to address this conflict when he had the plan to meet Arab leaders in in Georgia this was can canceled with mutual agreement after the what happened in the Baptist Hospital in in Gaza uh so uh previous round of conflict all ended in the same way uh uh you have the Egyptian mediation somehow you reach ceasefire and you exchange prisoners Israel is saying we uh this is different now we going we need to more uh destroy the infrastructure of Hamas or somewhere go radical wipe out wipe out Hamas or uh or much more decision Americans are saying we need to give Israel time and space to this operation Iran is saying no we're not going to do this we're going to warn with the multiple fronts so they don't do that so this is where we are at at uh at this point but inevitably the solution is this mediation a ceasefire how long it will take to get to this point this is a big question I think in the next uh days and weeks yeah I mean one of the biggest dangers some analysts are talking right now is about a miscalculation by one party or another notably on on Israel's northern border because hasbalah really seemed to be uh testing the patience of of the Israelis in in in that part of the country I mean hasb and Israel are happy with their satisfied let's be more accurate with the Rules of Engagement they had since 2006 On the Border but now hasb has been increas under pressure by Hamas uh to basically act as a deterence from Israel that if you open if you go in on the ground in in Gaza we're going to do this but so far it's been limited uh even I mean cross border yes but it's it's been limited they didn't go into targeting civilians or more than the Border uh so I think for now it's still uh but if the ground Invasion started then you see more tensions not only in lebano and and uh and somewhere else but I think there's no real tension directly between Israel and hisbah it's all in relatively linked to what's happening in Gaza so once Gaza went down the leane Border Israeli border will will immediately calm down but now it's tense everybody's on alert the region is is is is basically uh on the verge of of of some confrontation but uh but I don't see a huge escalation On the lianes Border because both sides are are not very invested in in such a scenario at least for now yeah least of all the Lebanese people who've been through enough thank you very much indeed Joe ma a global fellow with the

Hezbollah outposts we can speak now to Ali Hashim our correspondent On the Border he's live from dirra that's where this fighting has been taking place Ali just talk through exactly what's happening there yes Laura we are standing just in front of the post where all the uh shelling and launching of rockets was taking place uh for now we uh heard from emergency services that there are two civilians injured however there are many civilians who are kind of uh stuck in that area because they can't arrive there there are reports but they can't out there what happened today is that uh in the morning there were several guided missiles launched from the Lebanese side of the border on an Israeli military post and then maybe our U colleague R could take us towards the wall that's that's the the border line between Lebanon and Israel and that's where everything was uh happening so after the the guided missiles hit the Israeli post then we started hearing Israeli shelling now shelling was taken uh place um with drones uh not not uh uh not Air Raids or air strikes rather with drones artillery and um following that moment of strikes we started hearing gunshots so it seems there were some skirmishes now what we are talking about over here is just observations we don't have the clear pict picture it's just what we are able to see from this side we try to be as close as possible to the flash point um however this is this is part of a greater context a bigger context maybe could be explained later yesterday there were Rockets uh launched from South Lebanon from Hamas day of before yesterday uh Islamic Jihad infiltrated from this same area froma so U the tension is is mounting from the Lebanese side of the Border still an operation area but things are gradually getting out of control okay Ali thanks very much for bringing us the situation there on the ground well let's try and get a bit more context on the situation there we can join Zena Hoda she is with us from a village of called Maroon al- Ras that's along the Lebanon Israel border and Zena this has long been a volatile border so can we still say though that the fighting is a contained situation or has it spread wider than that it's still limited but it's gradually escalating it's day four since we've seen um escalation if you like along the Lebanon Israel border and what what we're seeing is you know attacks tit fortat attacks Hezbollah saying that this is in response it's targeting the Israeli position in response to the killing of three of its members two days ago um so both sides really limiting uh the uh artillery shelling or the attacks to military targets but this could easily change and already you hear some officials being quoted in Israeli media that the Rules of Engagement will change we're getting reports that some of the uh retaliatory strikes by the Israelis um hit close to civilian homes so the situation is very very tense we've been coming to this border over the past four days now when you drive along the border you don't see anyone people have left their homes uh the sound of Israeli drones constantly overhead the sound of Israeli war planes people of this region know very well that the possibility of allout War cannot be ruled out but Hezbollah has been treading carefully sending messages putting pressure on the Israelis telling them that if you continue this escalation against Gaza you will face pressure elsewhere and it's not just Lebanon yesterday they opened a new front and that is the Syria border um Hezbollah as well as other Iranian backed groups have positions along Syria's border with Israel there were rockets that were fired across the border yesterday really another message that your forces your resources could be stretched thin if you continue pushing with this with this offensive um but at the end of the day all I can tell you is that people here are worried you're getting uh you know a lot of news that you can't even confirm for example some local news agencies are saying that Hezbollah told the UN peacekeeping forces as well as the Lebanese Army that they should leave the area we called the unifil command they said this is not true uh the Lebanese Army has not said anything about this so tension is building up the pressure is building up as each day passes and as as you know Israel continues to put more and more pressure on Gaza then expect Israel to face more and more pressure from this front and the front uh bordering Syria okay Zoda thanks very much for bring us the scene there on that border Northern Israel and Southern Lebanon thanks very much"}, "HsDF_x0x2S4": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsDF_x0x2S4", "video_id": "HsDF_x0x2S4", "description": "Tensions along Israel's frontier with

as well now to discuss this further we're joined by Caroline click she's a former foreign policy adviser to Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Senior fellow for Middle Eastern Affairs at the center for security policy in Washington welcome on Kine thanks very much we having me right uh Caroline let's start right off from here is a two front War inevitable now for Israel um I I think that it's a it's a wrong question we've been in a two- front War uh from the outset actually it began in the north this time because heala began penetrating our border and conducting a crossb raids and probes many weeks before uh Hamas invaded Israel and committed its uh its atrocities against our people on October 7th and since that day kisala has been gradually escalating it's uh it's uh attacks on Israel with anti- uh with anti-tank and anti-tank shells and with uh missiles directed at our bases and at our civilian communities along the borders uh several several uh several of our soldiers have already been killed in these attacks Caroline Iran has been giving warning after warning or threat after threat now as you mentioned that Hezbollah has not started you know aggravating the situation with Israel now it has been happening much before the October 7th attack by Hamas now I just want to talk to you about the fact or the possibility of the Seas of Gaza and the stability in The Wider West Asian region how that can become how that can be affected with what Hezbollah is trying now will we see the current unrest spread across the wider West Asian region now that Hezbollah is practically getting involved and other West Asian Asians are already lik how the Arabia they're issuing warnings against leaving Lebanon right away right I saw a bunch of Western nations were also saying the same things to their Nationals and I think it's a good idea but I think that um you know right now uh we have to understand that this is an Iranian war against Israel it's not Hamas it's notala Hamas and kisala are Iranian proxies and the entire operation was planned and directed by Iran it was they had a coordinate they had several coordination meetings before October 7th I think the M most major one was in April all of them took place in Beirut and uh and the planning and the training for for the assault on October 7th the Hamas operatives were trained in paragliding and other tactics that they Ed uh to Massacre Jews on October 7th in Lebanon so um you know this Lebanon is a hub and Iran is the epicenter and it's spreading out so Iran is using its Shiite militias in Syria the houti forces are also interested in getting involved and attacking Southern Israel from Yemen so we're seeing a lot of these different fronts but they're all Iranian and so this is Iran's war against Israel and Lebanon uh is a very big threat because umbala actually has Firepower that is 10 times more powerful at least then uh Hamas hamas's missiles at Israel they have you know maybe uh 60 50 60 kilograms of TNT and uh and kisala has Precision guiding guided missiles that have you know a thousand 2,000 uh uh pounds of TNT so or kilos of TNT so we're talking about an order of many many orders of magnitude more uh dangerous they have 150,000 missiles and they ostensibly could shell Israel with 3,500 missiles a today uh given their level of Firepower so this is this is a much uh much greater threat that we're facing from the north from kisah but again kisah is Iran Lebanon is controlled by Iran Gaza is controlled by Iran Syria is controlled by Iran so all of them are active France we've been attacked from uh Syria as well uh by by Iranian forces in Syria so we're this is a push by Iran and one of the most alarming aspects of this is that yesterday the United States and and the other nations that are members of the security Council permitted the UN Security Council resolutions barring Iran from operating in the international market for ballistic missiles to expire um and so now Iran can openly uh purchase and uh export ballistic missiles uh to its Hearts content so this is a also a devastating development so all of this together is part of one War directed by tan Caroline now it's no secret that Iran has its proxies in all these nations you mentioned Syria there is of course Lebanon of course what we're seeing in Gaza there is Hamas there is Hezbollah there are several other proxies in Iraq as well now with all these kind of attacks which which we're already seeing starting against Israel how long can Israel continue it's surrounded by enemies at the moment how long will it be able to continue this kind of multipronged attack from all over um well I think that what we're trying to do uh is focus our effort immediately in Gaza though we have a very large uh uh troop uh levels uh along the northern border as well and um you know we'll just have to go as long as we have to go because this is a war for our national survival I I I would expect that uh countries that are facing similar threats and who value human life and who want to see the scourge of uh Jihad eradicated because it threatens them as well uh will be providing us with the aid that we need you know I mean we have a very strong military partnership with the Indians and and we would like to see uh I'm sure that uh uh cooperation with you in uh in terms of many of the aspects that we have to uh get our arms around in this war would be very helpful uh we're valid you're a valued Ally to Israel and uh also a friend so um you know that that's what I'm thinking Caroline now when the US president was in Israel there were two US bases in in we're talking about Iraq which were attacked by uavs and it is believed now that the the attack was carried out by Shia militias which are again backed by Iran so will with Hezbollah getting involved will it pave way for more militias to get involved along with this and was it a direct hint or a direct remark or a direct indication to the US that if you take more sides with Israel or is it as you continue giving support to Israel we will be attacking from all fronts the way they did in Iraq at the same time when the US president was there in Israel I I think that there are two ways that you have to look at this one is a perspective of how really Iran and and its and its proxies uh viewed Biden's visit um and uh and how and what we take away from it so um you know they the Iranians have always uh seen Israel and the United States as two sides of the same coin which is why they're terrorists from hisbah and its progenitor Amal attacked the US Embassy in Beirut and the U and the US Marine Barracks in Beirut in 1983 um because after Israeli forces left Beirut uh and were replaced by us peacekeepers from the Iranian perspective the the the Americans were just other were just other Israelis because they view the United States as the great Satan and Israel as the little Satan were two sides of the same coin so it's not surprising that uh when Iran is assaulting Israel that its proxies are also going to be attacking the United States so yes you had the attempted drone attack against US forces in in Baghdad uh that was foiled I understand thankfully um you also have had uh uh crowds of uh of kisala operatives uh surrounding the US Embassy in Beirut and besieging it you also have the same scenes in Aman uh Jordan so I think yes I mean what we're seeing is is the way that they're they perceive but they also see it as a as a show of force the fact that uh Biden came to Israel and made these uh the statements of solidarity and there are a lot of aspects to his visit that I found extremely disturbing and and I'm writing an article about that today uh at the Jewish uh uh news Syndicate jns.org where where I serve as senior editor but um there are a lot of aspects to that visit that that are disturbing but all the same in in the way that the image of Biden standing uh in Israel at this moment is translated uh in enemy societies is that uh in fact they're facing the combined force of the United States and Israel and that does have some uh deterrent power we'll have to see whether you know how how longstanding that's going to be but in terms of what you were saying of Israel having to fight a multi-front war um that allows us to juggle a little bit uh in terms of our operational Tempo and focus yes now I also want to get your thoughts on this and this is something which I've been thinking about and I need your opinion on this as well on one hand we saw three leaders from Arab Nations say no cancel a meeting with the US president hardly does anyone cancel a meeting with the US president we saw three leaders doing that when the isra when the United States president is coming all the way to Israel and is willing to come to Jordan and meet with meet with them now on one hand that happened which give the Impressions gives the impression that the West Asian nations are snubbing the US on the other hand it took the US president to come all the way to Israel to get Egypt to open that Rafa border so that some humanitarian Aid can cross through because there has been a lot of resistance in taking any kind of uh any kind of refugees from Gaza so I find there to be some kind of a dichotomy here what is the stance of the Arab Nations do they on one side they are sympathizing with the residents in Gaza but on the other side they do not want to take refugees either do you find some kind of dichotomy here or is this is there a larger game plan um so I think that the answer to CCE not wanting to bring in gazin to go to Egypt makes sense because I mean these are these are jihadists you know everybody refers to them as innocent civilians but you know they they they're mobilized on behalf of Kamas so um it's like the German Society under the Nazi regime that they had to be densified after the war because maybe they were weren't participants maybe they weren't combatants in World War II but uh they supported the war effort uh because they they were they were um they were Nazis and so it's the same thing I mean Kamas is an organic construct inside of Gaza that it is it is supported by the civilian population which also participated in the atrocities on October 7th you had thousands of Gaza ostensible civilians coming in and looting and raping and and taking women hostage and and cap captive and back to to Gaza to be raped um so you have you have a a a dual nature that people refer to them as innocent civilians but actually they're supportive population so Egypt outlawed the Muslim Brotherhood uh as a terrorist organization all these people are aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood so CC looks at them as a security threat to Egypt and that makes sense which is why you know I think what's most important is for countries that support Kamas like turkey which is an operational headquarters for Hamas and has taken in a lot of gazin a lot of them live in Turkey same with Qatar uh is the headquarters of Kamas I mean they're State sponsors of terrorism and I don't know why they're treated as credible actors in The International Community but certainly at this point if they care so much about the humanitarian situation in Gaza then they should be telling elisi and the United State should be leaning on them to do this that all all that uh is requested is that of of Egypt is that it'd be a Transit uh point for these people to then exit the region and and spend the war in turkey or in Qatar or in Iran or wherever they they they want but uh uh or any European country that's suicidal enough to want to bring them in but but the point is that um you know the the answer to the humanitarian uh uh crisis such as it is I mean the real humanitarian crisis obviously is the hostages that are being held in Gaza and uh and and uh and securing their release as quickly as possible really is is the only priority for anybody who's truly concerned about humanitarian issues because they're the only true victims here um and also I just want to I just want to add to that that you know there have been several deaths of civilians children women elderly and that has happened on both sides and that is definitely to be condemned on on both sides we've seen those kind of deaths any kind of death which is is can never be can never be condoned can never be celebrated but the deaths of civilians all of at least a child or an infant cannot be termed as as a as a militant or a terorist and that is definitely to be condemned as well I also wanted to ask I agree and I think that we have to we we just have to place the blame where it belongs I mean the author of all of this suffering is only Kamas it's not Israel um and it's very important to make that point explicit because Hamas is the reason why any of this is happening it's the reason why Israel has to defend itself by coming in and dismantling the Kamas regime through military means because you know obviously ly we can't peacefully coexist with this monstrous entity at our doorsteps that that has just uh committed the sort of atrocities that we we suffered on October 7th and we continue to suffer through the suffering of our hostages and the missile volleys that are being shot into our cities every day all right Caroline thank you so much for joining in

Israelis also carried out an air strike on a mosque in the West Bank overnight claiming Hamas was using that building to plan an upcoming attack and in Lebanon the threat from the Iranian backed militant group Hezbollah is growing prime minister Benjamin nanahu warns that if the group enters the war it will be crippled quote with a force it cannot imagine and for more I want to bring in Israeli government spokesperson tall hrich tall thank you so much for your time today uh we really appreciate a lot to get to uh but first it has been about two weeks since Hamas launched its horrific Terror attacks on Israel talk to us about the impact that that has had on isres and how life has changed since then it has changed significantly Tracy it's in fact day 17 since the October 7th Massacre and nobody in Israel is the same everyone in this country knows someone who was affected someone who was killed just to remind you the the casualties on the Israeli side it's 1,400 1,400 people were butchered by these barbarians uh so everyone knows someone who was killed who was abducted by Hamas who was injured we have thousands of people who were injured uh we have uh 200,000 people who were evacuated within Israel from their communities in in the South and in in the north because these are the front lines right now of the global war against terrorism so the country is not the same we are still working on trying to identify some of the victims some of these bodies are beyond recognition because of what Hamas has done to them and T let's talk about that that uh ground offensive that you all are preparing for why is that important what are the challenges there and why hasn't that taken place yet so it is important because uh you know President Biden was here and he he said when he came back to the United States he delivered an important speech where he said that we are at an inflection point in history and terrorists can no longer cannot get away with what they did Hamas cannot get away with what they've done to Israelis because if you are soft if if you address Terror with weakness and what they've done here is you know it's it's the worst crime against the Jewish people these are you know war crimes uh since since the Holocaust so they we we cannot let them get away with this with impunity because if we do so if we send out a message of we weakness we just invite more terror and it will happen again and again and again this is why we have to hit Hamas hard very hard and reach each and every one of these terrorists no place is safe for them right now and uh and send the right message also to other adversaries across the region and uh as for your second question Israel is a Sovereign Nation and and our uh military breast and our government the unity government that was established during this uh uh War are taking uh the the all considerations and making the decisions uh so when the time is right we will uh of course uh move to stage two stage three of the operation when the time is right when the conditions are right of course we're also working with International partners as you know because some of these uh uh civilians being held captive uh by by Hamas are also foreign Nationals or dual citizenship holders so we are communicating with International Partners but we will do whatever it takes uh to dismantle and and destroy this organization Tom some people may ask you know what is the endgame here so what is it for Israel the Israel is to dismantle Hamas we will dismantle them militarily they will no longer have military capabilities to hurt us as they did they will also lack the motivation to hurt us as they did we will bring down their governance bodies Hamas will be no longer in the Gaza Strip Tom I want to talk about how you Balan all of this and also the humanitarian aspect of that and also abide by you know International humanitarian law talk to us about that so we are abiding by uh international law uh we are not the aggressors here we were attacked we didn't even expect this war as you know we were surprised we were surprised in fact uh we didn't start with this war and we were dragged to it by Hamas this is why we're responding right now to their aggression of course we don't want any civilians In Harm's Way we don't want Israeli civilians In Harm's Way and we don't want Palestinian civilians In Harm's Way this is why we have evacuated our population so many people again 200,000 people from communities in the South and communities who reside close to the northern border the the Border uh with with Lebanon where Iran Iran backed hasbalah uh tries to test us and we hope they don't turn this into a full-fledged war on another front but we are also calling on the Palestinian civilians to evacuate within Gaza to move from the northern part of the strip to the southern part because the heavy fighting is will take place in in in the north so the IDF designated special routes for them we gave them prior notice of two days in fact P notice to move to these areas in in the South where where they have uh you know these are safer H Havens and humanitarian Aid is also awaiting and Tom we will leave it right there thank you so much for your time today we appreciate it God bless thank you [Music] [Music] Tracy"}, "POm7qqRaNnM": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM",

CNN has seen a buildup of military right along the border and now flares late into the night. This comes as Israeli government officials tell CNN's Nic Robertson that the troops have the, quote, green light to enter Gaza. Now, those officials also say that Gaza a 50 mile border with Israel, will look radically different after any military incursion. They tell CNN that a tough buffer zone will be established, one that would essentially be a no go zone in the IDF will be able to go into Gaza and arrest people whenever they want, theoretically on their terms, much like they can now in the West Bank. Joining us now at the magic wall. CNN military analyst, retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling serve. Good to see you. I want to start with the flares because Nic Robertson was pointing this out show video of it right now, and he made clear that that's not the norm necessarily in this moment. What does that tell you? It just tells me that the Israeli forces are looking for something or they're trying to use a little bit of psychological warfare against the people inside of Gaza. This is not that big of a deal. It is just to show potentially the commanders that are on the scene where different crossing points are what they're looking for. It's to orient those who are new to the area. The big question is, will this become a regional conflict? The president talked about that last night. Let's talk about what we have just seen in the region. The fact that two sources told CNN overnight that Navy warships, U.S. Navy warships operating in the Middle East had to counter multiple projectiles fired on the coast of Yemen yesterday. And then you couple that with what the Pentagon says are drone attack attempts in Iraq and where U.S. officials are in Iraq and and and Syria. Yeah, a couple of things that happened yesterday. The drone attack out off the coast of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden down here against the USS Carney, drew a lot of attention. Integrated air defense from that ship shot the drones and the missiles down that were coming out of Yemen. That's important. But the range from there to Israel is pretty far. And it's they don't have a great missile force, let's put it that way. But the other things that were occurring are would be a normal day in some in some countries, like the drone attack at Al-Tanf in Syria. That is a U.S. military base in that particular reason. It's been there for a while. Other drone attacks outside Air Force Base. I've been out there are many times in Iraq, Erbil, Baghdad and in the southern part of Iraq just tells me that the popular mobilization fronts, the Iranian backed rebels are actually targeting those kinds of locations just as harassment attacks. There was also two Israeli citizens killed in Egypt, which just shows that there's a swell of a ground movement that is a result of some of the things that have been going on there. And all of these Arab street does not want Israel to go into Gaza. Just take a step back to what your point has been. And I think it's very valuable to note that these bases, these U.S. bases are often harassed or often subject to drone attacks or rocket attacks. All of it happening on the same day, the same day the president gives an Oval Office address as Israel is preparing for what looks like a ground incursion, different proxies from Iran. But does that tell you something? Yeah, it's a call for it's a call for harassment. It's a call for attacks. It is a jihad. They are receiving information from Iran saying let's upped the ante a little bit and show our displeasure at what's going on in Israel. Moments ago, a large group of people were seen rallying for the opening of the Rafah crossing on the Egypt border. And you can see this. This is right outside that border a few miles around that crossing. There's craters in front of it. We understand about 20 trucks. Some of those drivers have told us they actually saw the Egyptian moving concrete as if there was a mate, maybe the possibility of an opening. But subsequently, CNN has learned that the Rafah crossing will not open today as had been anticipated. But that sense of on the ground and that that terrain desert gives you some perspective on where we stand right now. Just moments ago, we did hear from the U.N. secretary general, Antonio Gutierrez, who is at the Rafah border crossing on the Egyptian side. So he is there you got a U.N. compound on the other side where where we know people are better supplied than most places, but still with dwindling, dwindling supplies. And of course, he's standing where all those trucks loaded with aid are waiting to enter Behind these walls. We have 2 million people that is suffering enormously. So these trucks are not just trucks. They are a lifeline. They are the difference between life and death for so many people. In Gaza. What we need is to make them move, to make the move to the other side of this wall, to make the move as quickly as possible. So those cement blocks that I referenced, we actually have video of that. CNN has obtained that from some of these truck drivers who are sitting there night upon night and waiting, moving those blocks at the entrance of the crossing. There are those 20 trucks they are expected to enter once the crossing opens. The United Nations is saying that it needs, though, 100 trucks a day to provide adequate aid to the people inside Gaza. 20 trucks right now. And they need 100 a day. This comes as Gaza's main medical facility is in danger of running out of fuel within hours. No fuel has been coming into Gaza now for days. And, of course, to run a generator, you need fuel. All of that is now running out. Doctors Without Borders said yesterday that the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City only had enough fuel to run its generators for 24 more hours. That hospital is one of the few places in Gaza that actually even has electricity for now. And on that front, we have been getting dispatches from people inside Gaza daily. And, you know, we get these small clips and they cut out because of the phone connections because they don't have the power. Our journalist, Ibrahim Dam on Escape Northern Gaza in the south was his wife and two sons. He's been filing these dispatches for OUTFRONT every night. And here's his latest report on the situation in Khan Younis. A lot. And genuineness. I mean, Sarah, it matters. A man in front of a lot newness or no danger and official Baird will be there. And in between, the men lurking the land mines and so on will but the joy of newness will cost very much right JLP. If anyone is sarbjit done. I've done my hammamet my soul. Well, I'm I've been so budget done for my official fish, my the shuttle side of the of joy. We actually required to go and didn't get a little bit of something a month ago. So the world is turning into a white cloud. Something poetic and profound about that, that horrible image. Joining us now is Apple Brand. While the US executive director for Doctors Without Borders and Apple, I appreciate speaking with you again. I know that you have a team in this main hospital in Gaza, the Al-Shifa hospital. Can you give us any update on their situation Yes. I mean, we are really beside ourselves because we often lose contact with them, as you mentioned, with the lack of electricity, the inability to charge phones, cell signals often being cut out, very difficult to get real time information from the team. And what we do know is that our medical coordinator was warning that the fuel was reaching catastrophic lows. And of course, they will ration they will try to stretch it out as much as possible because you need that fuel to run generator for the lifesaving medical equipment, including incubators for neonates, dialysis machines and just just general functioning for all the trauma surgeries that they're trying to do."}, "GULvQ4sJrSQ": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GULvQ4sJrSQ", "video_id": "GULvQ4sJrSQ", "description": "US Ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, makes a statement regarding the situation in the Middle East.

terrorist attack on October 7th an attack that set so much heartbreak and so much Devastation in motion but let me be clear hopelessness is not an option here and so the United States has continue to work toward a goal that all of us should aspire to a sustainable resolution of this conflict so that Israelis and Palestinians can live side by side and enjoy equal measures of security dignity and freedom to set us down the path toward that future we've been working tirelessly with Qatar Egypt and other Regional Partners on a strong compelling proposal our engagement is the best opportunity to reunite all hostages with with their families hostages the security Council has in previous resolutions urged Hamas and other groups to release and it would enable a prolonged humanitarian pause longer than the one we saw in November allowing for more life-saving food water fuel medicines to get into the hands of Palestinian uh Palestinian CI uh civilians who desperately need it if accepted and implemented this proposal would move all parties one step closer to creating the conditions for sustainable cessation of hostilities the council has the obligation it has the obligation to ensure that any action we take in the coming days increases pressure on Hamas to accept the proposal we believe that the draft resolution put forward by Algeria does not achieve this end on the contrary this draft resolution could put sensitive negotiations in Jeopardy derailing the exhaustive ongoing diplomatic efforts to secure the release of hostages and secure an extended pause that Palestinian civilians and Aid workers so desperately need one thing this Council can and must do is get behind the two humanitarian resolutions we've already adopted that means focusing our efforts to support special coordinator Cog who just this week outlined steps the UN intends to take to accelerate and expand the delivery of Aid at scale her success and we've been clear on this her success is the un's success in Gaza we cannot afford to undermine her efforts or the sensitive negotiations taking place as we speak of course these effort for these efforts to work the United Nations must be situated to expand the provision of Aid we know unra plays a critical role in providing that assistance which is why there must be there must be a swift comprehensive investigation by the UN and an independent external review by a nonu body of unra including the serious allegations that it employe it has employees who participated in the October 7th attack and other related issues that is how we restore donor confidence and it's how we ensure that nothing like this happens again and we appreciate the secretary General's commitment to that end finally while I'm here I also want to Note new steps announced by President Biden to address the disturbing rise of settler violence in the West Bank president Biden has long spoken out against extremist violence in the West Bank and the executive order signed yesterday is a means of addressing these actions including Acts or threats of violence against civilians intimidation of civilians causing them to leave their homes destruction or seizure of property and acts of terrorism all of which undermine security peace and stability for Israelis and Palestinians alike ultimately now is the time to allow space for the sensitive hostage negotiations to proceed to get behind special coordinator cod's proposal and to hold accountable those perpetrating violence that undermines safety and stability because that is now how we begin to build toward a more peaceful future thank you and I'll take did you yes please so Ambassador how soon uh uh you are now to reach an agreement on this proposal and regarding the draft resolution do you mean here that it's not the time to discuss a draft at all or you think there should be a certain language in this draft to be accepted by you look uh I can't give you a time frame on negotiations negotiations take time but we're giving it that time we're giving it the effort uh on the ground uh the qataris have spoken about this recently as well and they are moving forward and they're committed to seeing us bring this uh to uh a conclusion so that we can see hostages brought home and humanitarian assistance brought in at scale uh what we're saying about the resolution is it's not timely we have two resolutions right now that we are working to implement that deals with the humanitarian situation it calls for a cessation of hostilities they have uh given uh the res the last resolution gave the special coordinator Cog a mandate to move forward on addressing some of these issues so we don't see that this resolution adds anything to what we already have but we worry that the resolution will hurt what we're doing on the ground right now I think we have time for one more James Ambassador you talk about those two existing resolutions the idea of those resolutions was to scale up humanitarian aid but you heard Martin Griffith in the council he talked about the need for multiple points of Entry to Gaza which Israel is not allowing he talked about Israel's frequent um rejection of much needed items into Gaza for unclear inconsistent and often unspecified reasons is Israel not in breach of those two resolutions and in fact in breach of the icj ruling just one week ago which again urged Israel to SC scale up humanitarian Aid look Israel uh we have met with the Israelis both in Jerusalem on the ground I met with the kak uh who was here uh this week to talk through the issues that uh the humanitarian Community has been experiencing and working with them to see how we can address these issues they were given a certain number of days to respond to the icj I think we need to give them allow them the time that they have to respond to the icj but I got a commitment from the Kat that he was going to not only take the concerns that were raised by Martin and others and by me uh on the problems that are being experienced on the ground and see how he can better address those issues how we can communicate better and work more closely with them I think the Israelis understand uh and this is what I heard from uh from the major general that they do have a role to play in assisting humanitarian uh uh Aid to get through to the people of Gaza we do have two uh routs that have been uh open and we're going to work on that it has been is just trickling in and Israel is the one that can control this it it has been but it's more than a trickle I have to say James uh but it's not enough it is absolutely not enough and we're working with all sides uh there's a tremendous amount of blame in terms of the blockages uh being put on the on the Israelis we're hearing

working with the UN there's a security situation on the ground as well and we have to be able to address those issues to ensure that the that we know that uh the people of Gaza are in need of that it

the starvation of of millions of people the displacement over of over two million Gins we have South Africa that has mounted a a court in the icj the icj ruled this week that Israel has a grave responsibility to prevent genocide they're still they're still determining whether it's a genocide do you think that still that it's still under investigation I believe that they are they're still determining it but in the interim ruling the fact that they said there's a responsibility to prevent it the fact that this word is even in play meanwhile dozens of US government employees are set to fast in protest of President Biden's support of Israel this coming Thursday now this comes as a new report in the Washington Post finds that members of gen Z are expressing their frustrations over the war in Gaza on Tik Tok and getting the White House's attention the post describes left leaning Tik Tok activists as an influential political force as the president seeks to win back the approval of younger voters a new Pew research survey finds among ages 18 to 29 just 27% approve of President Biden's job performance and 71% in that category disapprove yes those are terrible numbers especially for young voters who tend to overwhelmingly support uh Democratic politicians uh but that isn't that's just the tip of the iceberg here I think that sometimes when stories are read through the lens of young voters are upset they're easy to dismiss because young voters don't vote as at high rates as older voters do and there's a kind of trivialization of what's going on on here uh in some in groups where they say well it's just on Tik Tok it's just young voters but I think there's there's some evidence that the Tik Tok stuff really does bother folks as evidenced by the bipartisan interest in frankly Banning Tik Tok that we see in Congress and two although that that was going on well before well yes but it's because there online that the Tik Tok audience tends to be much more critical of the establishment policies in a number of different contexts including being at times critical of uh investments in the war in Ukraine and yes very very critical of the uh Siege of Gaza uh but additionally it's not just young people over a thousand uh black pastors representing thousands and thousands of constituents uh met uh with the white house advocating uh for a ceasefire the uh hington post reported that Michigan's top Arab elected leader uh has never been reached out to uh by the White House Representative Abraham I AOS uh and he articulated growing frustrations within the uh Arab and Muslim American communities particularly and important swing States and it is increasingly odd I would say that you're not getting clearer messaging from the Biden Administration and surrogates like AOC who ultimately performed the role in an election year when they've endorsed Joe Biden as a surrogate of his campaign as to what to do about that you see her giving a lot of I see you I hear you I understand I also agree that Gaza is a humanitarian crisis language but what does that mean if you're still in lock step from an electoral and policy perspective Ive with the man who is enabling that course of action yeah and it's not like Joe Biden is a some kind of shoe in for reelection where this doesn't really matter I mean he he's underwater his poll numbers are terrible nationally and in swing States um perhaps he he's governing a coalition that is just ungovernable but whatever the reason is um taking becoming even more unpopular with key demographic support groups including young people and minorities um is going to sink any chance he has I think with the young people you're right that they vote in in less um compelling percentage numbers but um but but clearly having young people on your side in terms of me like Camp door too campaigning less so now but in terms of messaging on social media in terms of um you know carrying the torch that kind of thing I think they do much more leg work than other groups um that was obviously very important to Barack Obama's um successful primary and uh election uh way back when so I I I do think it's certainly going to hurt him that uh that it's shaping up this way yeah and she's not exactly in this um age group uh I'm speak I'm going to talk about Taylor Swift you know she's a little older than the kind of young young young people age group that we're describing here but we covered yesterday she was invented in a lab in order to help get Joe Biden reelected that's the all right and people are really anxious about whether or not she's going to uh give by in the endorsement and part because her endorsement back in 2020 was meaningful apparently her post on in Instagram to her 272 million followers back in 2020 led directly to 35,000 voter registrations so there's a lot of power here so I do think that the the kind of conservative anxiety about um you know this is a plot this is a scam I mean she obviously did on her own accord uh you know four years ago so that is what it is but I think there's an interesting question on the other side for the Biden Administration which is is she going to be willing to stick her NE neck out again when Biden is so deeply unpopular and while he is seen as the enabler of one of the worst humanitarian crises we've seen in modern history if I was her I would want nothing to do with politics anyway I would just stay out I don't know why and and and truly maybe this is coming from an old person it Baff I know this is correct it just blows my mind it baffles me that people care what Taylor thinks about or people will vote for who Taylor Swift wants them to vote for or get registered because she tells them to I know that's the case I just can't identify imagine it like and it's not specific to Taylor Swift Just celebrities in general I don't care what they think about anything I think it's often the case that especially when we're talking about advocacy for issues that are not broadly accepted um socially and the the issue of Palestinian the issue of Palestinian rights is one of those issues that does not get mainstream Acceptance in liberal media and the liberal press um it's it's been a a third rail issue for so long that I do think it is incredibly powerful for people on Tik Tok who are basically Anonymous or very high-profile people to demonstrate that they're willing willing to publicly support the interest of Palestinians and call for a ceas I do think it empowers folks who've been told for years that this issue is too complicated don't weigh in you might be called anti-semetic if you have the wrong opinion and having a really high-profile validator whose ethics and values you respect for other reasons I think is actually enormously powerful and part of why Joe Biden uh maybe should be concerned not just about Taylor Swift and what she may may not do but about the overwhelming um direction of the commentary on Tik Tok it's just a right left maybe it's just a right left difference it always calls to mind those kinds of celebrity PSAs where they all say the same phrase the right left difference the right that just decided they're going to stop drinking Budweiser because they hired one influencer to hold a can of beer one time cuz they don't want to be lectured to by celebrities who have nothing to do with and no knowledge of the product it's consistent with that more Rising right after this"}, "nGV3Dp1DkHY": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGV3Dp1DkHY", "video_id": "nGV3Dp1DkHY",

killed three US service members and wounded dozens more here's White House National Security spokesperson John Kirby we do not seek another War we do not seek to escalate but we will absolutely do what is required to protect ourselves to continue that mission and to respond appropriately to these attacks earlier in the day us defense secretary Lloyd Austin spoke on the issue as well president and I will not tolerate attack on US forces and we will take all necessary actions to defend the us and our troops later Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh identified the soldiers killed in Sunday's attack the youngest victim just 23 years old the names of those soldiers who lost their lives were Sergeant William Rivers specialist Kennedy Sanders and specialist biona Moffett right now we assess that there are more than 40 that have been injured um we do expect that number to continue to fluctuate as uh our service members as you know with TBI report symptoms later on so that number could continue to grow the attack put new political pressure on Biden to daily a blow directly against Iran a step he has been reluctant to take out of fear of igniting a broader War Sunday strike marks the first deadly attack against US troops since the Israel Hamas War erupted in October the United States is trying to determine how the suicide drone managed to evade the base's defenses what I can definitely say is that the strikes that took place on US service members represent a fundamental change in the Rules of Engagement Allison mcmanis the managing director of the Department of National Security at the center of American progress says she anticipates a response to the Drone attack quite soon Iran has taken advantage frankly of the the current moment of conflict to do what Iran has been doing for many many years which is to disrupt uh to Target the US and partners in a variety of ways um mostly through the efforts of its um proxy militias so again what Iran is doing is testing where that line is how much it can get away with in uh targeting us interests whether those are military interests or economic interests um and and really testing the US in terms of its response US troops have been attacked over 150 times in Iraq Syria and Jordan as well as on warships in the Red Sea with houthi fighters in Yemen have been firing drones and missiles at them three US service members were killed and dozens more wounded after a drone attack on US forces stationed in Jordan a person familiar with the matter identified the base as Tower 22 in northeastern Jordan an outpost near the Syrian border shown in this still taken before the attack us Central Command said at least 34 were injured with that number expected to change as more seek care it's the first deadly strike against US forces since the Israel Hamas War erupted in October and sent shock waves throughout the Middle East Jordan which holds extensive exercises with US troops throughout the year condemned the attack in a statement at a campaign stop in South Carolina on Sunday US President Joe Biden asked for a moment of silence for the fallen soldiers in Ed to respond and we shall respond in a statement the White House blamed Iran back groups for the attack the Islamic resistance in Iraq an umbrella organization of Hardline iran-backed militant groups claimed attacks on three bases including one on the Jordan Syria border US forces have come under attack more than 150 times by Iran back groups in Iraq and Syria since October while the United States has maintained that Washington is not at war in

Israel has LOST! Iranians will WIN!\"", "uploader": "Inner Vision", "transcript": "will Biden attack Iran I believe the answer to that question is yes um look we just go back just a few years ago before Biden became president during the presidency of Donald Trump the Iranians shot down an American drone the global HW um and Trump was advocating for a retaliatory strike against the air defense facilities in Iran on Iranian soil which is reasonable it's not an unreasonable uh action but the Pentagon said whoa hold on boss if you strike Iran on Iranian soil they're going to retaliate everywhere and it's going to begin a pattern of escalation that lead to a general war that we're not prepared to fight right now and Frankly Speaking even if we took the months or years it took to get ready to fight we can't guarantee Victory we we can't tell you we're going to win this one and Trump back down that same professional military Council of course doesn't change with the new Administration it still exists and I believe that Iran's case for being able to a withstand an American attack can be inflict significant harm on American Assets in the region has only increased since that time the military professionals know this and I believe that they have counseled Joe Biden accordingly I don't believe we're going to attack Iran uh the approximate reason for the uh attack that hasn't yet occurred was a strike on an American Outpost in an outpost of an illegal base uh in Syria for which there is no Authority uh no International legal Authority and a complete refusal to Grant Authority by The Sovereign government of Syria what were the Americans doing there and who do you think struck them well you're absolutely right for first of all to talk about the importance of differentiating between the American claim that these service members were at Tower 22 which is an adjunct to a larger area 55 or alom Garrison that's in Syria um because we can't admit that if we were on Syrian soil understand that um Nations that are illegally occupying territory have no inherent right of self-defense against those of whose territory they're illegally occupying so the United States has made a false claim that we were on Jordanian soil the Jordanian government of course said no that's not the case um the the purpose of the American Military presence there and it's actually a coalition military presence we have uh I think some Norwegian troops and on occasion we rotate in other uh NATO or european troops um is the anti-islamic state or anti-isis Mission um but the United States itself acknowledges the Pentagon acknowledges that elom is not involved in that anymore uh that that is pretty much died down what alom does is provide training to local Syrian tribal elements tribes ironically which had previously been loyal to Isis but are now working on behalf of the United States to destabilize the regime of Bashar alassad in Syria so we are literally a terrorist operation on Syrian soil and the people opposing us are the militias in Syria and Iraq who are against this ongoing illegal American presence on their soil and have opted to strike against America as a sign of protest over America's support of Israel's actions in Gaza so they were struck by militias some of which have been armed by Iran um now I find it hypocritical and indeed somewhat ironic uh that Joe Biden says that the reason why we're after Iran is that they have provided weapons to these militias that they've used to strike Americans well wait a minute Joe don't you provide a hundred billion dollar worth of weapons to the ukrainians and have them and and sit back and allow them to use those weapons to kill Russians um are you thereby saying that because Iran did this we have a strike a right to strike Iran that Russia has a strike right to strike America I mean there's no consistency in the American argument it's the it's the argument of Nation that's in panic Joe Biden knows that he can't do anything against Iran he also knows and he's admitted it about the hoodie that we can't deter the hoodie from continuing to do their operations to shut down Maritime traffic in the in the Red Sea all the military strikes we've done have been to no avail whatever we do in response to what is a tragedy for the American soldiers involved the death of three American soldiers the wounding of dozens of others um whatever we do in response is not going to end this tragedy it's all it's going to do is perpetuate a cycle of violence guaranteeing that more American soldiers are going to die more Iraqis are going to die more syrians are going to die more Palestinians are going to die and that's the Crux of the problem this could all be ended today if Joe Biden would pick up the phone and tell BB Netanyahu to stand down but we won't do that we'll come to that uh before we do though uh let let's look at the other dog that didn't bark the other shoe that didn't fall uh this week uh we were told in what clearly a scop uh that uh Israel was imminently about to invade in a ground Invasion uh Southern Lebanon and tried to drive the Lebanese resistance back beyond the latan river which they've been trying to do actually uh as long as I've been involved in this and that that goes back 5050 years uh the latan river is is fixed in my mind as the place that Israel kind of believes is its border uh with Lebanon but it never happened uh the Israelis did not invade Lebanon are they going to well I'm I'm loathed to try and give you an absolute statement of uh you know assurance that they won't but I'm tell you right now that they won't and I'll tell you why they won't because they will get destroyed by Hezbollah uh Hezbollah learned a lesson in 2006 by the way a conflict at Hezbollah won um Israel did not defeat Hezbollah in 2006 nor did Israel defeat Hezbollah when Hezbollah drove Israel out of Southern Lebanon uh in in in 2000 so you know Hezbollah is 2- 0 against Israel uh Hezbollah also learned something about the 2006 conflict and that is that Israel is took the fight to Lebanese soil and Israel inflicted horrific harm on the you know the city of Beirut on Lebanese villages in southern Lebanon and Hezbollah made a determination that if there's going to be a fight with Israel in the future that that fight won't be exclusively on Lebanese soil that Hezbollah is going to take the fight to Israel and Hezbollah has been training and preparing for this what I can guarantee you is two things one that Israel will never reach the Lani River uh they will be allowed to penetrate into Southern Lebanon to a certain depth at which point they'll be stopped by pre-planned Hezbollah defenses and then find themselves trapped as over 10,000 Hezbollah Fighters appear on the soil of Israel and will capture Northern Israel seize the Galilee isolate the Golan and there's nothing Israel can do to stop this nothing the Israeli military knows this the Israeli government knows this the United States knows this that's why I believe that Israel will never attack Lebanon and never initiate this so-called Lani offensive because it's a literal Act of suicide let's go to the big enchilada then you identified it as such a minute or two ago uh the conflict in Gaza uh there are reports the Egypt and Qatar uh are brokering a 45 day ceasefire big exchange of prisoners uh and uh a big uh a big um influx of humanitarian aid but Netanyahu has completely denied this and he's saying that the war will continue wh which which is right well as long as Netanyahu is in power Netanyahu is right he's he's correct it doesn't mean that there aren't discussions taking place I'm sure that there are discussions taking place but let's go back and review the statements made made by Netanyahu since October 7th a ceasefire or a prolonged pause um Netanyahu says represents a defeat for Israel um an exchange of prisoners is what Hamas wanted all along that's a defeat for Israel and to provide humanitarian Goods uh to the people of Gaza reverses the genocidal policies that Israel has been embarked on since the beginning of this operation policies designed to uh evict the Palestinian population from Gaza this would be a defeat for Netanyahu Netanyahu right now is struggling not only for his political survival but frankly his survival as a free man because you know he lost his Gambit to take control of Israeli courts the Israeli Supreme Court has said that his modifications of basic law will not stand which means that once he leaves office he will be held accountable in the court of justice for for his many crimes of corruption he and his wife and they will probably be found guilty and spend the rest of their lives in jail he doesn't want this he is desperate for some sort of Miracle to occur that isn't going to occur the Israeli Defense Force was fought to a standstill in Gaza by Hamas something I predicted would happen with absolute certainty uh Israel has acknowledged that they at best have accounted for 20% of hamas's tunnel Network um but they don't know the extent they say it's larger than we thought um Israel never took control of Northern Gaza Israel never took control of Southern Gaza Israel is withdrawing its forces because they can't afford to stay in Gaza because the losses are too high this is a victory for Hamas a military victory for Hamas and it's also a political victory for Hamas remember Netanyahu said that we will eradicate hamas's a political movement Hamas has become more strong and more legitimate since October 7 if there were free and fair elections amongst the Palestinian people not only in Gaza but on the West Bank today Hamas would win they would win the presidency they would win the legislative body um the International Community has rallied behind the cause of the Palestinian people and the cause of the Palestinian people is on the front pages only because of Hamas so Hamas has emerged stronger as a political movement today than ever before this is a defeat for Israel and then there's the economic aspect Benjamin Netanyahu has been defeated militarily politically and Israel is being crushed economically the consequences of this war are weighing hard on the Israeli economy the actions of the hoodi and shutting down Maritime traffic in the Red Sea is destroying the economy of Southern Israel the port of Elliott is empty of shipping um then yaho is a man who failed the Israeli people on October 7th and he's failed the Israeli people ever since and yet he's not man enough to acknowledge that he should step aside he is putting the security of Israel the well-being of Israel not and and of course the well-being of Palestinian people but he doesn't care about them but he ostensibly cares about the people of Israel he is risking them for his own narcissistic love affair with his notion that he is somehow the savior of Israel no no no he is evil personified he is Satan in flesh he is the worst thing that has happened to Israel in its modern history and until he is removed from power I don't believe there's going to be a ceas fire or any of the measures that could lead to a resolution of the conflict in Gaza now I told you there were so many wars uh would' have difficulty covering them all in the time available and so finally uh in the Ukraine uh zalinski tried to remove dely the chief of the Army staff but that appears to have been aborted there was a backlash uh and uh it's always difficult to try and remove the chief of the Army staff in the middle of a war and if you try and fail that places the politicians in some Jeopardy doesn't it yes I mean what we're looking at here is a clear example of the uh absolute chaos that uh that exists inside Ukrainian politics today um and at the center of this is what to do about the defeat that Russia has inflicted on the Ukrainian Army the Ukrainian Army is in Desperate situations desperate Straits um they they run out of money the United States is no longer providing them with arms equipment or financing Europe's U pipeline has slowed down dried to a trickle or nothing um and yet Russia's getting stronger and so the the question is what does what what does Ukraine do zalinski has been confronted by the military with their requirements for dramatic mobilization the zusy says I need 500,000 men and I need them right now to fill the gaps zalinsky says wait a minute if you get them one uh it's going to be very traumatic to get this we'll have to rewrite laws and things two how are you going to train them how are you going to equip them you'll just be sending them the front line to die like we already have this isn't the right step we need to find another way but zi recognizes that um there is no other way that Ukraine is on its last legs so zalinski confronted zi uh couldn't get zi to agree with him threatened to fire him zi stood up to him the entire Ukrainian military command backed zi when the commander and chief who's ostensibly supposed to be in charge of everything is told by his Collective military that we have no faith in your leadership we have no faith in your judgments well George it's over it's all over but the shouting and I wouldn't be surprised if sometime in the not so distant future some of the things that we've talked about previously occur and that is that zilinsky will be removed from Power by the Ukrainian military because they recognize that he is the cause for much of the problems that they face today"}, "hV7KXN7L_gU": {"url":

East correspondent for The Economist who's based in Dubai good morning to you Greg good morning thanks for having me pleasure a pleasure um first of all what would you make of the significance of of the US and the UK now being involved in in strikes on on territory belonging to three separate Sovereign Nations is that a cause for concern everything that's happened over the past four months in the Middle East is a cause for concern I mean I think to to what you said before these strikes in Iraq and Syria yesterday they were calibrated sort of to to send a message but not signal an allout war against Iran I mean you've had Republicans in America who've been demanding that Joe Biden strike directly inside of Iranian territory that's something that America hasn't done since the 1980s and even then it was attacking Iranian ships in Iranian Waters but not Iranian soil directly the Biden Administration has ignored those calls it's bombed Targets in Syria and Iraq that America has been bombing for years honestly some of these locations going back to the Obama Administration have been the targets of American air strike so I think no great surprise that this was how America chose to respond but it's yet another escalatory step after four months of escalation across the region where going from here because so far the houthis for example every time they suffer a strike just say you know we're going to come back harder I asked Grant shaps two weeks ago I said if this continues what is the plan do we just continue making strikes against them and if so what is the plan again where does it lead to do you have any idea there's not really a plan I mean when you speak to American officials when you speak to British officials you know people throw around the word deterrence a lot that these strikes are meant to deter the houthis from attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea uh they're meant to deter Iranian backed milias from attacking American troops but as you say clearly that isn't working we're almost a month now into this campaign of of anglo-american strikes against the houthis and they continue to fire uh ballistic missiles and and use drones to attack ships they're determin to keep this up at least so long as the war in Gaza continues so if deterrence is working then what is this meant to achieve there are some people in the Pentagon who say the idea is to degrade their ability to carry out these attacks so if you blow up enough of the hois anti-ship missiles they won't have any more left to fire at commercial ships but you get into what could be a very long game of wacka then where you're trying to find individual weapons scattered across large countries and held by a constellation of militias bringing Greg back back to the situation in Iraq one of the things I was reading yesterday is I was trying to sort of hint at earlier is the fact that you've had uh Iranian militias operating in Iraq for quite a long time fighting what was perceived as a common enemy and those militias were brought under an Iraqi umbrella the popul population mobilization forces the pmf and one of the uh spokespeople for the Iraqi government last last night said I'm quoting directly the American side intentionally engaged in deception and Distortion of facts stating coordination with Iraqi authorities uh this is an unfounded claim crafted to mislead International public opinion evade legal responsibility uh for this condemned crime according to International laws and principles they're they're essentially accusing America of attacking allies I think is what you could perceive that the the Iraqis are saying you know these forces whether they're Iranian or not were under their umbrella they have been officially brought under this this umbrella of the Iraqi government but in practice uh some of these militias are more powerful than the Iraqi government and they're not really answerable to what is a very corrupt very ineffective central government in Baghdad and that government is now in sort of an impossible position on the one hand it does want to maintain this small presence of 2,500 or so American troops that are deployed in Iraq uh with Iraqi government's consent to work on on counter Islamic State operations on the other hand it has to deal with these militias that are incredibly powerful that are borrowed into various Ministries and and parts of the security apparatus and want to drive the Americans out and and the Iraqi government sort of finds itself caught in between uh these two competing power centers can I one last question to you if I may and this is one that that sort of bothers me because academics have have tried to explain it to me are we in the UK have we chosen a side are we on a sort of Team Sunni versus shears because every time I read the phrase Iranian proxies what we're actually talking about is is Shia militias based in different countries that share the view that they have been persecuted or are persecuted by the sunnis U Saudi Arabia being a sort chief operator there a country Saudi Arabia that we're very close to and I'm just wondering for the benefit of the listeners whether that is the case that we are we are quietly on one side in this conflict a side that perhaps we don't need to be on no I think if you look at this it's not really a a religious thing I mean if you look at a country like Lebanon for example the Shia are probably the largest uh demographic group in Lebanon although no one is sure because there hasn't been a census for almost the century and yes historically they were a downtrodden Community but they now control the most powerful political and and military organization in the Lebanese government which is heah if you look at Iraq uh they are a clear majority of the population there the prime minister is Shia uh they're they're not really in a position now where they are downtrodden minority which which arguably my point my point being that Iranians can operate within Iraq because the Iraqi government being majority she or the Iraqi country being majority Shia would be more open to that possibly than having forces from Sun supporting Nation or a Sunni majority Nation there it is more open to it but it's also you know you speak to some people some Shia in Iraq some in Lebanon not everyone is happy about the fact that you have these incredibly powerful iranian-backed militias that uh in in both of those countries wield more power than the state and if you think back a few years in Iraq in 2019 2020 there was this Mass protest movement against the government was largely a Shia Le protest movement one of the things that they were bitterly angry about was the fact that the government was was in many ways controlled from tan and was uh beholden to the Iranians so it's not something that even in these countries the the Shia population is is entirely happy about tell you what that's that's a great insight there Greg a reminder of those protests I'm indebted to you that's Greg carlstrom Middle East correspondent for The Economist I'm going to go straight now over to Mark leoty former spokesperson for NATO good morning to you mark good morning everyone is in danger of sliding in not because we are escalating but because we're in a situation which is inherently escalator um Iran is the emerging power in the region it wants to see itself gain power and it's using its proxies as a way of gaining power so it is the one if you like that's on the offensive so the question is what do the people who don't like what Iran is doing do about it if you do nothing Iran is encour encouraged if you do something there's a risk that you then end up in a spiral of conflict so in that sense um Britain us all of us are in a kind of dilemma um the military have a concept for which is escalation dominance who controls the pace of escalation um and alongside that's another familiar phrase which is weakness is a form of provocation um did the houes do what they're doing the Red Sea because we did something or because we did nothing and and that's the issue that they have suppose we stopped bombing uh attacking them will they stop they have made the link with Gaza but it's not a legitimate link it's the link they've chosen to make and that then gives them control of the Red Sea Co can the world afford to have the houthis control the Red Sea entrance whenever they want there dilemas all around on that on that very last thought should the world allow it's not a world situation at the moment it's the US and the UK and for those of us who went through Gulf War I and Gul War II there are people asking in the message boards how come we've already had two wars in the region we've had bombing raids as we've just been hearing going on for years from the Americans it's clearly demonstrably not working and yet that appears to be the plan again well I mean it comes back again what's the alternative um that and I genuinely don't know so I have to say I don't know exactly so so in one sense you know sometimes we have to be a little bit um um sympathetic to our leaderships because there the obvious alternative simply doesn't exist the Red Sea cannot afford to be blocked by the houthis whenever they want it to be for whatever reason they want it to be um most of the world um most of the developed World um May have its concerns but the one thing they don't want is the houth in control so quietly they're supportive and they're just not getting stuck in which then leads to the second Point you're making if you'd like me to continue on that which is um you know I was a BBC defense correspondent for 11 years I was in NATO for 20 um I have watched the steady slow decline of Britain's military power from my entire profession Life as a security related correspondent so are we capable of fighting a major war the answer I have to say is um basically no we can do it with NATO and that's one of the good things about NATO NATO doesn't require any of us to be totally powerful it requires us to in combination be powerful enough and we are but Britain was meant to be one of the lead Nations and there's no question that our military power has steadily declined and in size terms look at the casualties in your in Ukraine yeah our army would have been basically destroyed three or four times over"}, "owbGCk7gcZ8": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owbGCk7gcZ8", "video_id": "owbGCk7gcZ8", "description": "The US says it struck 85 targets linked to Iran-backed militias

I do  want  to  get  to  this  video here. just   released  by the  US  Central  Command showing a B1  bomber   that  took  part. in  those  us  retaliatory strikes now  the US  saying  that  it  hit  more  than  85  Targets in   Iraq  and Syria,  and the  morning in  Iraqi militia  official  appearing to   downplay  the US  strikes and  hinting at  an  attempt.  to   deescalate  tensions  in the   Middle  East  now we  are  also  getting a word  here   from  officials.  both  in   Iraq  and Syria that  the  death toll  from  these  strikes is  about 40  a lot  to  all of  this  here. so  I  do  want  to  bring in   a friend  of  the show   a friend  break it  down.  Mark  Chandler  is  the  director  of  government   relations and a professor of   practice  in the  department   of  intelligence  and  Community studies at  Coastal  Carolina  University. He  is   also a  former  senior   intelligence  defense  official  as  always  mark.  Thank you so much for taking   the time  to  be  here  with   us  and help  break down. a  very  complicated subject.   Good  morning.  and  you're quite  welcome Josh.  Hopefully we  can.  create   some  understanding here   this  morning.  of  course,  and I want to go  kind of  back  to  Basics  first and  break down  the details.   What  is  it  that  we  know   so  far?  about these us   strikes over  in  Iraq  and  Syria?  well  first and  foremost  Josh, let me  say  thanks  to  the military. and  the service members who  conducted this, uh  dangerous  operation number  1.  Uh,  they  achieved  I believe the  Tactical. success that  was  asked of  them  to  achieve  so  and they  all returned   safely. So  I think that's   important.  I want to put  that  out there.  first and  foremost. and and what  they   did actually  was attack   about 6 or  7 different  areas.  in  Iraq  and Syria,   where you had both  irgc   Iranian revolutionary guards   Corps,  personnel and the  Shia  militias  the Iran   backed Shia militias  those  were  all known targets and  as  a matter  of  fact   during  my  time  in the   Pentagon  and the Marine   Corps we  had struck  those  targets.  uh, previously  so   they  struck  those they   used  85  sub-targets within   that  so  describing  a  Target my Might be  a  compound. and there might be.  6 or 7  locations on  that   compound  where they   actually  struck  those are  individual  targets and they   launched  some.  125 precision.  Munitions  using b1s based in  the  United  States, which is   a long  haul  but something  we  have  done  before. and  also  some  of  those fighter  aircraft  that  we  had in   the Middle  East  already  that  we  positioned   a couple  of  months  ago.   So  tactical  success.  on  a  wide  ranging Mission  instead of targets. and I  want to talk  about the  mission itself. What  is  the  ultimate  goal  here  for the  US  is  it  about taking  out  some? uh  military  there or   is  it  about sending a  message Is  it  kind of a  mixture of  both? Well, I I  think that's  a good   question. Josh  and I think  1 thing Let me  kind of  separate  what  we  hear   coming  out of  the Pentagon   the White House and the state  department  at this time. And  then  what  we  should  be   trying  to  do. militarily   so  number  1 I haven't heard  a strategy  and I haven't  heard what  the overall  objectives  of  this   campaign. This  isn't a  single  set of  targets  according to  the the White  House and and the Pentagon   So, what  are our objectives   from  for this  campaign? And  when  I look  at  that  I  have  to  say that  okay, I  haven't heard that. and so   we  need  to  know  that. to   be  able  to  answer  your   question  thoroughly. I'd  have to know  what  those are  but what  I see.  is  this   is  kind of a public   relations campaign. it  first  thing you hear. yesterday  when  we  start talking about  this  is  we  hit.   85 targets  we  used  a 125.   Munitions. We used a  B1   bomber  from  the United   States  This  is  a public   relations campaign. showing  the US  Military. strength   and capabilities. to  strike   around  the world.  at  any  time  of  our choosing  but  did it  achieve the  objectives  that  we  should   be  focused on? tactically?  Yes,  I believe we  hit those  targets,  but broader on   deterrence. I'm not so  sure   we  did that  but but are we   really  trying  to  deter  because we've had plenty  of   opportunities to  do  so, so   I have  to  balance that  out  between the success that   these service members.  had.   versus what the administration is trying to say we're doing   so I think  and you're   going to  see this  today  You're  going to  see a lot  of  photos  come  out of   damage buildings  destroyed  buildings and that's  kind of  leading to  hey we  did  something because we  had to   do  something but but truly  what  did we  achieve?   That's  the question. And  I do  want to pull  up  this   video you were  talking  about.  video.  pictures  and  all of that that  will  come   out and this  is  video that   was released  a short time   that  shows 1 of  those B1   bombers you're  looking at   there now Iran's  president  sent  a threat  to  the US   Friday  saying  that  quote  it  will  not start a war.   but if  a country if  a cruel  Force wants to  bully us  the  Islamic Republic  of  Iran   will  give  a strong.  response. What  do you  make   of that statement?  I feel   like  you and I have  been   on  here  multiple  times and  we  have  talked  about  threats from  Iran. What   do you  make  of  that   latest  statement there?   well, I I number  1 I'm not  surprised by  it. I I  believe.  after last   Sunday's  attack  that  that   killed. 3 US service   members,  I think after that.  Iran  had to  set the stage  to  try to. publicly   threaten the  United  States.  because actually  they  they   haven't felt  any cost. Iran   has felt  no  cost  So   putting that  out there.   again not unexpected  I think  there's trying to set the  stage to  a possible   retaliation.  and and I fully  expect. retaliation.  I mean   you're  going to  have  to   do  that  if  you're  are on   to  show. strength. to  their  populace. to  the Ayatollah  and to  the Shia  militias   out there.  So  working  through that. I I think it's   kind of balancing out what   the it  was expected  to  be   happen  from  the United   States  at  this  time. I do   think they'll do  something  but they  would have  done   something anyway, Josh   without that  statement or   not,  and they  made  those  statements  since 1979. So   so  this  is  not out of   character for for the Iranian  regime. why is  Iran  not  being?  struck  here  Is   that  something that  could  potentially?  happen  Because  again we're talking about.   Iraq  we're talking about.   Syria,  but not Iran. Well,  that's  the old 64000  question  Josh. Why are we   not striking  Iran, They   they  are behind. all of   these attacks against the US   forces  in the  Middle  East.  They're behind  what  the  houthis are doing.  They're  behind  the October  7th attack  that  Hamas  conducted on  Israel  and  they're behind  what   Hezbollah Lebanese  Hezbollah  are doing in  uh, Northern   Israel, So  you've got  to   look  at  this  overall.   strategy  that  Iran  has had  and and when  we  talk  about  this, I go  back  to  what   are the objectives  What  are  our what  is  our strategy?  for these?  attacks that we  conducted yesterday?  And so   when  I'm looking at  that   if  it's  to  deter then  we   have to go to a Iran  and and  listen  I have  thought in  2  war in the  Middle  East. I  don't want  to  see.  another  War but honestly. weakness   is  what's  going to  drive  us  to  a war not.  striking   back. with  strength  and  focus on  the true.  perpetrators  behind  all of   those attacks,  and that's   Iran  We  do  not have  to   hit.  Terron  itself. We   don't have  to  hit any  major.  population  Center. I  could go  in  and a matter   of fact I know  they  exist  targets of  the irgc. near   the coast.  we  could hit  some  economic  targets out.   there we  could we  could  create  cost. for Iran  and  show  them  that  it's  it's   going to  be  too much. in   those costs for you to   continue. pushing these  attacks against the United   States. and I think until we   do  that. you're  going to   see Iran  continue to to   Rattle  Sabers  and attack   US forces.  It  may not be   tomorrow, Although  I do   think we're going to  see a  Counterattack from  the Shia   militia soon. but it's  it's   going to  happen. I mean   Iran, has actually  been  at   war with  us  since 1979. I  can go  back  to  the 1983.  bomb  bay route bombing.   Barracks  where we  killed.  241 service members.  I can  go  back  to  when  they   attacked  us  after we   invaded in  2003  Iran  irgc   were  in  Iraq  and causing  the death of  US service   members.  so  they  have  a  long  history of  this. they   haven't been  deterred   overall,  but at  some  point  we  have  to  send  a message  and we  have  to  impose   cost  against Iran  itself   What  is  the strategy? I'm  not sure  this   Administration  has won  that's  been  clearly  identified  either   internally. and especially   externally  to  to  the  American  public  and to   those who wish  us  harm   in the  Middle  East. And  we're talking about a lot of   statements  here. So  let's  talk  about 1 from   Hezbollah.  They  said  that   quote.  they're announcing   the suspension  of  military   and security  operations   against the occupation   forces  in  order to   prevent.  embarrassment to   the Iraqi government. What   is the  significance  of   that  statement Overall?   What  are they  trying  to   say?  well  I think that   goes  back  to  what  Iran   said  about,  you know.  retaliation should  anyone   strike? their interests and  their targets and by the   way.  technically we  did  strike  their  interest in their targets by   hitting some  irgc   facilities. in  Iraq  and  Syria,  so  we'll see how  that  plays out.  But  as for Hezbollah, I think  they  were  trying  to  well   I know  that  they  were   trying  to  manage  the  messaging.  after conducting   these strikes.  strikes.   They  then  came  out  and said  we're not going to   do  this  anymore.  So  what   it's  trying  to  do  is   create  that  that   International messaging if   you will  that  that  says   we  can now retaliate against  the United  States  because  they  attacked  us  after we   said  we  were  going to   stop  now.  Let's let's not  forget  that  there's been   hundreds  of  against the US   forces  there not just   these 3 Yes,  but we  lost  a  civilian  contractor  in   Syria about 2 months  ago.   as  a result  of  Iraqi  attack. I mean  Iranian  attacks and then  finally  we've lost  2 seals.  So   when  I look  at  this. I  think that  the  tip Hezbollah messaging was  merely  to  try to  play  to   the court of  public  opinion  out there.  and give  them.  there and give them some   pseudo  justification if  you  will  for continuing  attacks  against us  because now we're  perceived as the aggressor.  Should  we  expect  to  see  more  strikes soon? You  kind of already touched on   this  but is  that  something  that  we  do? expect  we  are  going to  see maybe in the   coming. hours days  weeks How  long  until we  see.   another.  strike  because it   does  sound like  President  Biden has said  we're not  done  yet.  what  and they   have  and they  had we're not  done  yet.  They've used  the  phrase  campaign. This  is  a  series  of  strikes.  So  a  campaign  lasts for days  or   weeks.  and it  starts  to   spread that out now.  if  the  administration  did its job  if  it  followed  the  military  advisors  and and  they  focused on  things  we   should  see another round of   strikes today.  or  this   evening.  overnight in  Iraq   and Syria,  so  we  should   see another round of  strikes  as  soon as today.  to  go   after now the process.  it's   actually  taking  place now  and it  started last  night.   is  the intelligence   Community is  going through  and they're looking and  analyzing each  1 of  those  target  areas that  were   attacked  last  night.  and  they'll determine what  we   call  BDA battle  damage   assessment. and through that   analysis. and whatever  their  objectives  that  they  were   told  destroy this  building   destroy this  command and  control center. They  will   give  an  evaluation  that   we  achieved  success.  or   we  did not achieve success  and where we did  Did not we   should. restrike  those  targets.  so  we  have  to   ensure  that  we  met the  objectives  on  those.   targets then  we  should   have  a second  set of   targets.  ready to  go  and  we  should  strike  those.   it  it  should  be  to   maintain  the pressure  that   has to  be  maintained. on   this  they  they  should   start tonight and we  should   start to  see more  assets.  into  the region. and perhaps  in  addition  to  just  Man  Fire  aircraft. You should   see some  Cruise  vessel.  attacks also  coming  from   our Naval assets. So  that's   what  we  should  be  seeing.  This  should  be  a  sustained.  and campaign. if   the true  intent  and true   objective is  to  go  out  there and destroy some   of these  but I don't know.  are we  destroying  or   are we  deterring that's  the  big question? And I want to  talk  a little  bit more   about the conflict  in  the  Middle  East  between Israel.  Hamas Hezbollah the houthis.   There's a lot going on  and  there's a lot of  different  topics  that  you and I have   discussed over  the past. I  would say several weeks and  really  several months  at   this  point.  Hamas has yet  to  respond to  the latest.  uh  ceasefire deal  that   would allegedly release all  of  those hostages  that  do   remain  that  were  taken on   October 7th.  What  might be   the hold  up  their well, I I  think you've got  a couple   of  critical  things. this   actually  started a couple   of  weeks ago.  and it  and  it was  a complicated.  6  phase.  peace proposal  that   that  was worked  between  gutter. Egypt.  uh, Israel.  Hamas and the United  States   So  all those parties were   talking behind  closed  doors  that  went  about 2 weeks ago  completely. fell  apart.  It   was just  too complicated So   you're  into  about 3 phases   right now.  of  this   current.  agreement and  Arrangement that  we're  looking at  So  when  I look   at  this  the key components   are the release of  the  hostages  as  you talked   about but there's a critical   sticking  point.  and that   that's  where Israel  and  Hamas are diametrically.   opposed.  1 of those. is   Hamas says  we  want  full   withdrawal  of? Israeli  forces  from  Gaza  Israel   says  they  don't want  to   do  that. So  we're talking  about a what's  on the  table  is  a 6-week  pause.  or   sensation of  hostilities.   and then  once  that  begins   we  start releasing the  hostages, but the key  sticking  point as  I said   is  Will  Israel  withdraw   from  Gaza, that  would be  a  military  disaster. Uh  all  the gains that  they  have   made  in the  last  several  months. to  try to  push   them  off back  and you still  have  at least  half  or   a little  bit more  of  Hamas  fighting  capability  and  existence that  would put  that  would make  Israel   lose  all of those  military   gains and set its objectives   back  while allowing  Hamas  the opportunity.  to  refit  rearm and resupply  which is   what  they  want. So  how  Hamas responds to this? not  getting their way in  an   Israel? in my opinion needs  to  stay  strong  and not  lose  its military  gains,  I  think that's  where you're   going to  see things  start  to  break down. if  they're  going to  break down  is   right there at  that  key  point of  withdrawal  versus   not withdrawal. a lot of   great information there my   last  question  for you is   going to  be  about the  houthis.  I know  this  is   kind of a a loaded  question   and a hard  question  to   answer  but what  is the   latest  with  that  situation  there involving the houthis?   You know  if  we  go  back   a few weeks.  Josh  when we  started we  saw the US  UK   attacks,  They've done  2  rounds  of  They've you see  the US  conducting. limited  pinpoint  strikes against  uploaded  missiles  or  other  facilities  right there.  uh,  and just  the other day.  uh   the houthis were  preparing  to  launch  a surface to  air  missile against US aircraft.   We  took  that  out.  uh   this  hasn't  stopped the  houthis.  They  continue  to   load  up  missiles. They   continued to fire I mean, as   recently  I believe is  today  they've tried to  attack   shipping  out there.  they've  gone  directly  against  US Naval  vessels operating  in  the area, so  our  deterrence  effect  in  our  degradation while minimal on   degradation we  still haven't  deterred  the houthis from   conducting  these attacks.  I  mean  we  started we  have   seen  the negative  impact   on  shipping. uh  throughout   the European  area  and even   the United  States. you know,  you've got  shipping   companies.  That  won't go   through there. So we  don't  have  a safe  passage area   through the VBA mandev  or   the Red Sea at  this  time   and the houthis have  not  been  destroyed.  their  capabilities  have  not been   destroyed.  So  they're  going to  strike  back   matter  of fact,  I would  expect  an uptick in  houthi   strikes and show  solidarity.  with  their Iranian back  she  and militia,  who were   attacked  last  night.  So  I  I'm going to  see this   kind of balance out in  some   public  messaging start to   take  place.  considering  they  all are managed.   controlled  and supportive by  Iran. All right,  Mark   Chandler  there with  Coastal  Carolina  University  as   always. Thank you so much for  taking  the time  to  be   here  with  us  and break  down  all the latest   details.  There's a lot to it  and we  appreciate  you being  here  with  us  pretty  much   on  a weekly  basis.   anything  else  you want to  add about any of  this   before  I let you go. Well,  well  Josh, I want to go   back  a little  bit to  that   Iranian statement the Iranian  threat  and some of the  words.  that  I hear  the  administration. talking  about.  not seeking  escalation. not wanting to   war in the  Middle  East.  you know. Strategy  is  it's   hard  to  determine that  as   I said. but but there is   war with Iran,  but it's from  an  Iranian perspective.  and  what's  happened  here. And  what's  critical  to   understand  is. is  the  United  States  does  not  control the tempo of  this   campaign  the tempo and the  escalation. escalation   ladder if you will   is controlled by  Iran  They   have  been  attacking us  and  I gave  those examples  for  decades of  what  they've  done  the 1660  something  attacks now are controlled   by  Iran  we  didn't  need   to  suffer  those 3 deaths   last  week  we  could have   stopped these attacks  against US  forces  about 140  attacks ago had we  sent  a  strong  deterrence   message at  that  time. Iran   does  not want  to  fight the  US  in  a 1 for 1 War the  cost would  be  extreme.  It   would be  regime  would  falter, uh, perhaps  collapse and  so  you have   to  look  at  that  and  realize that it's time. time   for the US  to  use strength   and not worry about  escalation  we  have  to   control the tempo here. I am   not.  advocating  war in  any  sense of  the imagination,   but I am  advocating.  strength  through deterrence.  if  we  need  to  do  that   because as  I said, we  don't  control the tempo at this  time, Iran  is  kind of  calling the shots on  how  this  plays out even  though   we  had a big public. success  last  night and that's  how  it's  going to  play  out.   I'm not trying  to  be  a  cynic.  I'm just  trying to  be  a realist here. and I  guess it's  not even  a  question  to  ask who has the  stronger  military  the us   or  Iran  and its proxies  there.  I think the answer   is  probably  the US  right?   Correct.  We  have  the  strongest we  just  need  to   utilize it. All right,  Mark.  Thank you again for taking   the time  to  be  here  with   us. We  appreciate  it.  Thank you,  Josh.

CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME WHY YOU BELIEVE, BECAUSE IT'S A REALLY, I'M AFRAID, CONTESTED TOPIC RIGHT NOW. WHY DO YOU THINK THESE CIVILIAN AREAS ARE BEING HIT. >> THE FIGHTING IS TAKING PLACE IN OVERCROWDED AREAS, IN URBAN AREAS, WE KNOW THAT FIGHTING IS TAKING PLACE IN GAZA CITY RIGHT NOW, BUT WE HAVE STILL, WE ESTIMATE THAT THERE ARE STILL AROUND 3 TO 400,000 CIVILIANS IN THIS AREA, SO TO TAKE THE EXAMPLE OF THE JABALIA CAMP, IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST CROWDED CAMPS IN THE GAZA STRIP, BUT WE STILL BELIEVE THERE AROUND 40,000 PEOPLE REMAINING THERE. SO YES -- INCLUDING THE UNWASHED SCHOOL, UNFORTUNATELY, HAVE BEEN UNFORTUNATELY ALSO HIT -- ARE MORE SAFE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE. >> HOW DO YOU CATEGORIZE THIS, THEN? IS IT ACCIDENTAL? IS IT A WAR CRIME? IS IT DELIBERATELY NOT DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN CIVILIANS AND HAMAS FIGHTERS? >> ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL LAW, THERE IS A -- PROPORTIONALITY, AND ALSO OF DISTINCTION. WHEN I WAS BRIEFING THE SECURITY COUNCIL, THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE BEING KILLED SO FAR IS SO STAGGERING, THAT THIS CANNOT BE COLLATERAL ANYMORE. >> CAN I ASK YOU, BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING TO YOU, AND WE HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY, YOU HAVE BEEN INSIDE GAZA FOR THE FIT TIME SINCE OCTOBER 7TH, YOU'VE CALLED IT, I BELIEVE, THIS MOST SAD DAY IN ALL YOUR HUMANITARIAN WORK? TALK TO ME ABOUT THAT? >> I WAS FIRST TO GAZA 30 YEARS AGO. GAZA IS A SOCIETY I KNOW VERY WELL, IT WAS A VIBRANT SOCIETY. IT WAS EXTRAORDINARILY SAD, BECAUSE I VISITED THE SCHOOL, AN OVERCROWDED SCHOOL, SHELTERING THOUSANDS OF DISPLACED PEOPLE, AND BASICALLY THE ONLY ASK THAT PEOPLE HAD AT THAT TIME WAS GIVEE WATER, PLEASE GIVE ME A LOAF OF BREAD, AND LATER ON, I WAS TALKING TO MY STAFF AND GAZA, AND THEY WERE CONFIRMING THAT TODAY THE GAZA STRIP IS RUNNING OUT OF EVERYTHING, RUNNING OUT OF FUEL, RUNNING OF FUEL, FOOD, RUNNING OUT OF MEDICINE, AND THE MARKET IS COMPLETELY DEPLETED. IT'S EXTREMELY SAD TO SEE HOW MUCH NOW THE POPULATION IS COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT -- DEPENDENT ON INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY -- WHICH IS NOT IN POSITION ANYMORE TO DELIVER AT THE SCOPE WHAT THEY NEED. WHAT I SEE RIGHT NOW IS I AN ENTIRE POPULATION BEING MOVED TO THE SOUTH, AND WHICH BASICALLY HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AVAILABLE. MANY OF THEM LEFT WITH VERY LITTLE THINGS. AND THEY ARRIVED IN THE SOUTH, WHICH IS COMPLETELY OVERCROWDED, TWICE AS POPULATION NOW, NO MARKET, NO GOODS AVAILABLE ANYMORE, AT THE MARKETS, SERVICES ARE COLLAPSING, AND THEY ALL DEPEND ON US RIGHT NOW. >> SO DO YOU UNDERSTAND, AND DO YOU ACCEPT, WHAT WE SAW, WERE INSTANCES OF LOOTING, AND THE INTERNATIONAL AUTHORITIES SAID THAT THE SOCIAL FABRIC IS STARTING TO BREAK DOWN IN GAZA. >> THE SOCIAL FABRIC IS INDEED BREAKING DOWN, THE CIVIL ORDER IS BREAKING DOWN, AND I UNDERSTAND, YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE, QUEUING IN FRONT OF BAKERIES NOWADAYS, JUST WITH THE HOPE TO GET A LOAF OF BREAD, AND WE ARE NOW PUT IN SITUATIONS WHERE IT IS BECOMING ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO OFF OF BREAD FROM THE BAKERY THAT WE ARE SUPPORTING, TO BRING BACK TO OUR SHELTER, JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE 100 OF OTHER PEOPLE EXPRESSING THEIR HUNGER IN FRONT OF THIS BAKERY, AND I UNDERSTAND ALSO THAT THIS HUNGER IS TURNING INTO ANGER AND WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, AND -- AND THE UNWASHED IS THIS FACE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, IN THE GAZA STRIP. >> EVEN DESPITE WHAT WE UNDERSTAND IS A HUMANITARIAN TRICKLE, I'M CALLING IT A TRICKLE, YOU TELL ME WHAT IT IS, WHAT'S COMING THROUGH RAFAH? >> LISTEN, CHRISTIANE, WE NEED MUCH, MUCH MORE. BEFORE OCTOBER SEVEN, THERE WAS AN AVERAGE OF 500 TRUCKS INTO GAZA, AND THIS WAS ALREADY DESCRIBED AS BEING A BLOCKADES, AND YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR THE POPULATION OF GAZA STARTED TO BECOME MORE DEPENDENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN COMMUNITY. WE WERE, FOR EXAMPLE, PROVIDING 50% OF THE CALORIC NEED OF 1.2 MILLION PEOPLE BEFORE THAT. TODAY, AFTER AN ALMOST TOTAL SIEGE, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A HANDFUL OF TRUCKS COMING IN TO THE GAZA STRIP AT A TIME WHEN THE MARKET IS ALSO COMPLETELY DEPLETED, AT A TIME WHEN THE LAST REMAINING PUBLIC SERVICES HAS COMPLETELY COLLAPSED. SO YES, THIS HANDFUL OF TRUCKS, BASICALLY DON'T DO ANYTHING TO REVERSE THE FACT THAT GAZA, THE GAZA STRIP, IS BEING STRANGLED BY THE SIEGE. >> FELIPE, CAN I ASK YOU THIS, THERE'S A LOT OF CONTROVERSY OVER FUEL, FOR INSTANCE. AND REPORTS CITING ALL SORTS OF, ISRAELI, WESTERN, OTHERS, MIDDLE EASTERN, THEN OVER THE YEARS HAMAS HAS STORED AND HOARDED ALL THAT IT NEEDS IN ITS UNDERGROUND TUNNELS, WHERE THERE'S FOOD, MEDICINE, FUEL, FOR ITS WAR EFFORT. AND THAT IT COULD HAVE ENOUGH TO FIGHT FOR 3 TO 4 MONTHS. GAZA IS A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE AND WHEN HE WENT 30 YEARS AGO. OF WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE HAMAS AUTHORITIES, VIS-\u00c0-VIS TAKING CARE OF CIVILIAN NEEDS? >> SO LISTEN, WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS, NO ONE RIGHT NOW IS TAKEN CARE OF THE CIVILIAN NEEDS. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE FUEL, I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT HAS THE MILITARY BEEN BUILDING UP OF THE HAMAS, IN THE GAZA STRIP, BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE AS AN ROY R. RESERVE A FUEL HAS COMPLETELY DEPLETED, AND WE ARE LOOKING AT WHERE AND WHAT OTHER FUEL IS AVAILABLE IN THE GAZA STRIP. THERE'S -- COMMERCIAL FUEL, THAT WAS AVAILABLE, AND THERE WAS ALSO FUEL THAT WAS BROUGHT IN BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, TO SUPPLY THE ELECTRIC PLANT. OVER THE LAST WEEK WE HAVE CONFLICTION WITH THE ISRAELI -- THEY'RE REMAINING FUEL, THE REMAINING COMMERCIALUEL, WHICH WAS AVAILABLE IN THE GAZA STRIP, WHICH MEANS, IN THE COMING DAYS WE WON'T BE ABLE ANYMORE TO SUPPLY BAKERIES, SUPPLY HOSPITALS, SUPPLY THE WATER STATION, BUT IN THE COMING DAYS WE MIGHT EVEN BE UNABLE TO MOVE OUR TRUCKS WITHIN THE GAZA STRIP, TO PROVIDE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO 700,000 PEOPLE, FOR EXAMPLE, SHELTERING IN OUR PREMISES, BUT ALSO TO THE REST OF THE POPULATION. >> I HAVE TO SAY, IT STRUCK WITH ME WHAT YOU SAID AT THE BEGINNING, WITH ALL THE CHILDREN WERE ASKING YOU FOR ANSWERS OF WATER AND A PIECE OF BREAD. IT'S HEARTBREAKING TO HEAR THAT. AND ALSO YOU, YOURSELF, AS UNWRAP, HAVE LOSUR DOZENS OF WORKERS TELL ME WHAT'S THE SITUATIOTH YOUR OWN EMPLOYEES ON THE GROUND? >> WE HAVE LOST, AS OF NOW, 72 STAFF. THE LAST STAFF I JUST HEARD WAS DISABLED STAFFER, SHE WAS DOING COATING, WE ONE YEAR AGO PUBLISHED A VIDEO ABOUT WHAT SHE WAS DOING VERY PROUD OF, AND SHE'S THE LAST PERSON REPORTED KILLED AMONG 72 PEOPLE. I MET THE STAFF YESTERDAY IN GAZA, BASICALLY THEY ARE SHARING THE SAME DIFFICULTIES AS ANYONE. THEY WERE LIVING IN SHELTER, THEY'RE STRUGGLING ON A DAILY BASIS TO FIND BREATH, TO FIND WATER, TO PROTECT THEIR CHILDREN, AND DESPITE THAT, AND DESPITE THE HEAVY LOSSES WITHIN THIS ORGANIZATION, THEY REMAIN COMMITTED TO DO WHATEVER IS POSSIBLE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO THE PEOPLE IN GAZA. BUT IT'S A CONSTANT DAILY STRUGGLE, BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT I TAKE A LOT OF INSPIRATION IN THE STRENGTHS AND THE DEDICATION. >> WOULD YOU EVER CONSIDER WITHDRAWING STAFF, JUST LIKE SOME WOUNDED PALESTINIANS ARE BEING EVACUATED? DUAL NATIONALS ARE BEING ALLOWED TO LEAVE. >> WE ARE -- SCALING UP OUR OPERATION, I HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR WE, NEED TO SCALE OUR OPERATION, WE SHOULD NOT CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT 50, 60, 70, TRUCKS. THIS OPERATION NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT UP AT SCALE, IF WE WANT TO RESERVE AN ONGOING, CIVIL BREAKDOWN, BUT IF WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE DO NOT START TO DIE BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT OF THE SIEGE, BECAUSE OF OUR DIFFICULTIES TO BRING OUR SUSTENANCE AT SCALE, TO THE GAZA STRIP. >> FELIPE, I WANT TO ASK YOU ATTACH A QUESTION. EVERYTHING IS DISPUTED, NUMBERS ARE DISPUTED, DEATH TOLLS, WHO'S A CIVILIAN, WHO'S A FIGHTER. THIS PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY, IS A HAMAS-RUN AUTHORITY IN GAZA, AND THE OFFICIALS IN RAMALLAH, SAY THAT NOW OVER 9000 PALESTINIANS HAVE BEEN KILLED SINCE THE WAR BEGAN, AFTER OCTOBER 7TH. I SPOKE TO FORMER ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER A HOOD ALMOST THIS WEEK. HE SAID THESE NUMBERS ARE EXAGGERATED, AND I QUOTED YOU, BASICALLY SAYING THAT IN THE PAST SIX CYCLES OF CONFLICT, HAMAS FIGURES HAD BEEN CONSIDERED CREDIBLE, BY ALL SIDES. TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID. >> THE U.N. NUMBERS ARE AS CREDIBLE AS HAMAS NUMBERS. -- I DON'T TRUST YOU ARE NUMBERS, THEY ARE NOT RELIABLE. >> WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT? >> LISTEN, I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE 72 STAFF MEMBERS OF ON WHAT ALL ARE RELIABLE, THEY HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED, THESE ARE OUR FIGURES, AND IF I COMPARE IT TO 72 WITH OUR 13,000 STAFF IN THE GAZA STRIP, WITH A 9000 BEING -- MINISTRY OF HEALTH, AND THE 2.2 MILLION INHABITANTS IN THE GAZA STRIP, WE HAVE MORE OR LESS THE SAME PERCENTAGE OF"}, "mpfgayQIxxE": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpfgayQIxxE", "video_id": "mpfgayQIxxE", "description": "Journalists weigh in on the political reaction to rising acts of hate amid the Israel-Hamas war and growing calls for a ceasefire.

a ceasefire possible? | CTV's Question Period", "uploader": "CTV News", "transcript": "[Music] if Canada can't figure this out tell me what corner of the world is going to figure this out welcome back to question period as we were discussing earlier in this show that's the Prime Minister this week calling the recent rise in anti-Semitism in Canada terrifying he's also continuing to support humanitarian pauses in hostilities which Israel has now agreed to do daily for 4 hours but here at home there are also loud calls for him to support a total ceasefire including from the NDP who wrote him an open letter asking for exactly that so can the federal government strike a balance between domestic pressure and its position that Israel has the right to defend itself the scrum is here to talk about that shell Eveland is the managing editor at the hill Times Robert F is the Ottawa bureau chief for the Globe and Mail and Robert benzy is the Queens Park bureau chief for the Toronto Star hi everybody hello really good to see you today uh Rob why don't I start with you uh this week certainly was the most I think since October 7th that we heard from the Prime Minister particularly as it concerns the rise in in anti-Semitism and then as he said also in islamophobia what do you think of the way he's uh navigating what we just outlined in the introduction there I think that the Prime Minister said some things that needed to be said vashy that that probably should have been said a little bit earlier I mean we're seeing a lot of um troubling incidents across the country on Friday a few blocks from my office at Queens Park the Indigo store was vandalized with some uh graffiti criticizing Heather reesman who is Jewish who is the the founder of that company and it it's very troubling that a lot of the things that are happening in the Middle East are kind of being Amplified on social media here and then coming onto our streets so I think it's important that everyone kind of realized that Canada has a role to play on the world stage but the fight that is happening in Gaza and in Israel it's not necessarily uh what should be happening on the streets of Toronto or Ottawa or Montreal what's your sense Charelle of the kinds of pressures the prime minister is facing even from within his own caucus I mentioned the NDP writing that own that letter rather that public letter calling for a a ceasefire more largely or or wider in scope than any kind of humanitarian pause there are also members of his own caucus like three dozen almost three dozen of them who have signed another letter echoing that call your sense of how that's playing out behind the scenes you get the sense that people aren't necessarily feeling heard and so you start to see I think over the past couple weeks more and more open letters to the Prime Minister I'm thinking of one that was signed just the other day by um I believe it was liberal and P Peter fona and it was you know it's addressed to the Prime Minister it's calling for a ceasefire but it's not you know delivered quietly to the Prime Minister it's put out on social media for everybody to see and you get the sense that those types of things are happening because they're not necessarily feeling heard or they want to especially signal to the wider population that hey I am saying this and I'm saying it publicly and I'm saying it in front of you for everybody to hear me so that you know what my uh where my I don't want to say call Allegiance is but but where my thoughts are on this so when you have those kinds of Divisions within caucus and you have them playing out publicly it is you've got to think it's got to be a difficult situation to manage and prime minister is not necessarily well known for you know listening to and Fe having all of his MPS feel as though they're being heard by him it's interesting also because as the leader of the Liberals Bob he's in a more unique position versus for example Pier Pia with the conservatives or jug meing with the NDP their caucuses are have different positions but they're United around those positions the liberal caucus is really the only one that's split to the degree it is yeah but the prime minister is in lock step with the United States and our allies on this um you know he's not going to call for a ceasefire right now because the Americans are not calling for a ceasefire and that's because they're afraid that Hamas will regroup again and you have to remember that Hamas holds medieval Theocratic views uh and they have modern weapons and they want to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth at the same time the horrific um images of women and children in in Gaza is is heartbreaking and the Americans and the Canadians uh and the Europeans are are asking the Israel Israel to you know you've got to have pauses um and I you know the thing here that we need to hear from Israel and I don't think you're going to get it from BB Netanyahu unfortunately is that you want to work with the United States Europeans the Canadians moderate Arab states when this war is over and Hamas is gone to have a viable Palestinian Authority a state with the West Bank and and Gaza which is not living in the kind of poverty they are but they can they're going to rebuild that into a really prosperous country it's going to take some time but we have to hear that from Israel at the end if we don't hear that this is going to continue and continue and continue well I think that's also politically Salient here in Canada as well right because in the absence of that and and you know to some degree I'm not saying it's understandable but the Focus right now Rob is on what's unfolding you know acutely or or or more imminently but I think Bob's point is a good one right like the the long-term impacts of this are also really significant do you anticipate that challenge continues to grow for the federal government here or like Bob says are they just going to remain in lock step with the US which has articulated a very specific position as well I mean I v I think Canada has to remain in locks up with the United States and the United Kingdom um and when we saw France talking about a ceasefire macron was talking about that and Mel joli kind of echoed that which but I don't I think she went off in a different direction from the Prime Minister on Thursday but I I do think that our foreign policy almost always Echoes the United States and on and in the Middle East I think it should although we didn't move our Embassy to Jerusalem like the United States did under under uh ex president Trump uh it's still in Tel Aviv uh I've been to rmmc it's a nice a nice spot in Tel Aviv but uh I think I I I think the challenge as Bob mentions is what happens after this war um the rebuilding of of Gaza is going to be very expensive uh Hamas it's it's a different Beast altogether and and what happens after this war is over is going to be a really interesting challenge for the whole world frankly I think here in Canada the same question applies though shell because um what we have seen is like hard to unsee like the things that have happened over the past month domestically um I think leave an impression that politicians who whatever part's in charge is going to have to reconcile with yeah absolutely and I mean we're seeing it um I think a little more across the border in the US where you know President Joe Biden is really feeling um you know politically in the polls like he is seeing a a a drop in support from certain parts of the population who have traditionally supported him because of his stance and because uh in in supporting or how far he's willing to go in support of Israel uh how much that is going to um affect the Canadian political scene um obviously yet to be determined but I can't imagine that there wouldn't be people who are right now looking at what's going on seeing how politicians are reacting and thinking about the future okay on that note I'll leave it there Charelle Eland Bob F and Rob benzy thanks so much"}, "U52Q2GI2Qak": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U52Q2GI2Qak", "video_id":

Gaza since the start of the war and this is the United Nations University in Tokyo these scenes will be repeated at un offices around the world on on Monday the organization has confirmed the number of deaths of its staff is the highest killed in any conflict since the UN was formed in 1945 well let's speak to Juliet tumor who's un's director of communications she's joining us from occupied East jerusalm Juliet good to have you with us again on Al jaer so 101 unra humanitarian workers killed in the Gaza Strip since October 7th tell us about who they were and how your work has been impacted yes uh these are our dear colleagues and our dear friends more than 100 of them have been killed they were mainly teachers but also School principles one doctor a number of Engineers support staff uh people who were in charge of safety for example um many many of them were killed um with members of their families some were killed um while they were on their way to bring bread for their families it's it's a global day of mour for the United Nations as we remember those colleagues and we pay tribute to their service at Andra how has your work on the ground been impacted by by these deaths and and the injuries that your uh colleagues have sustained this is uh only one challenge that Andra is facing we're being hit uh from different directions the war itself is definitely one challenge the SE and the tightening of of The Siege and the restrictions that we have on the number of trucks that we are able to bring in very very little no fuel fuel is running out for Andra the largest humanitarian agency and then the the shelters I mean we're close to 800,000 people now taking shelter under the very same flag that is being lowered around the world this morning they came to the those un facilities under facilities in search for protection and for safety yeah you you talked about The Siege and uh the safety o of uh people who have sought shelter at un schools schools that have been bombed so what what is the focus of your work right now given these uh difficult conditions on the ground The Siege in in Gaza City The Siege around hospitals there what are you focusing on right now look on our facilities that were impacted we can confirm that more than 60 6 Z have been impacted most recently yesterday one of our guest houses where we have staff sleeping and staying in in the Gaza Strip um that they received three direct hits um yesterday morning and we were very very lucky because it was just uh an hour and a half after our staff left that guest house and went to work so um this is increasing and 70% of those facilities that were impacted happened south of w Gaza so in fact in the middle areas or in areas like kanun or RA in the South it's an indication that nowhere in Gaza nowhere is safe not the north not the middle and not even the southern areas our Focus right now is to provide assistance to those families who came to seek refuge and protection under the very same un flag that was lowered this morning yeah as you say nowhere is safe and many Palestinians were told to move from the north to the South for their safety uh I I know that some of our colleagues had to move have have your colleagues from unra also left the Northern parts of Gaza City and all these areas which are under heavy bombardment and are now in the South yes yes many many of our staff uh 13,000 of them many were forced to flee as part of the forced displacement of the Palestinian communities across the Gaza Strip so they are like the rest of the communities however they many many of them are still there many many of them are still serving and providing to the communities under very very challenging circumstances and we also had staff who were there when the Exodus happened over the past few days of mass populations moving forced to flee forced to flee their homes in Gaza City and in the north and they reported scenes that resembled very much the 1948 War people arrived after walking on foot for hours dehydrated and exhausted right when you when you see Juliet what's happened over the past five weeks the death toll of more than 11,000 the mass Exodus as you say newborn babies being removed from their incubators did you ever imagine it would reach this level it's unprecedented on all levels it's unprecedented not only uh operationally for us it's extremely challenging but the death toll the death toll including among our colleagues and and and staff at at anra the challenges that we're facing in terms of the very very tight Siege the restrictions that we have on our operations and the fact that we don't have fuel it's a very simple thing that we need to have so that we can drive our cars and trucks and Reach people with the assistance they need even that we don't have Juliet thank you very much for taking the time to speak to us Juliet tumor is the spokeswoman for unra the un's refugee Agency for Palestinians live there

THIS IS A SENSELY POPULATED AREA, SOME 2 MILLION PEOPLE. WHAT ARE YOU KEEPING AN EYE ON IN THE COMING HOURS AND DAYS? >> Reporter: I THINK FIRST ONE OF THE THINGS TO POINT OUT IS THE GAZA STRIP IS NOT MUCH BIGGER THAN WASHINGTON, D.C., A TINY SPACE WITH ABOUT 2 MILLION PEOPLE IN IT WHO HAVE BEEN UNDER MILITARY OCCUPATION FOR DECADES. HALF THE POPULATION THERE IS CHILDREN AND THE LIVING CONDITIONS, THE UNITED NATIONS CALLED IT UNLIVABLE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME NOW. IT IS IN THIS SPACE THAT BOMBS ARE RAINING DOWN LEFT AND RIGHT. ELECTRICITY HAS BEEN CUT OFF BY ISRAEL. FUEL FOR BACKUP GENERATORS HAS BEEN CUT OFF BY ISRAEL. 5,000 ARE WOUNDED IN HOSPITALS\nTHAT ARE OVERWHELMED AND ARE THAT ARE OVERWHELMED AND ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO FUNCTION. I AM GRAVELY CONCERNED THAT WHAT WE ARE WATCHING UNFOLD WILL AMOUNT TO A GENOCIDE THAT WILL MAKE MANY OF THE HORRIFIC SCENES WE HAVE SEEN IN THE LAST FEW DAYS PALE IN COMPARISON TO THE DEATH WE ARE ABOUT TO WATCH TAKE PLACE IN THE GAZA STRIP. I'M VERY CONCERNED THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS SENDING A SIGNAL TO ISRAEL THAT IT CAN DO WHATEVER AT IT WANTS, REGARDLESS FOR THE CONCERN OF THE CIVILIANS ON THE GROUND IN GAZA. IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED HERE, AND I KNOW YOU'RE DOING A VERY DIFFICULT JOB IN TRYING TO REPORT THIS STORY, BUT YOU AND MANY OTHER NETWORKS DON'T HAVE PEOPLE IN GAZA RIGHT NOW. WITH ELECTRICITY BEING CUT OFF, IT'S HARDER AND HARDER FOR PEOPLE TO REPORT THE REALITY OUT FROM GAZA. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A BLACK BOX WHERE THE WORLD DOES NOT SEE WHAT IS TAKING PLACE ON THE GROUND DAY IN AND DAY OUT. THESE ARE ARE CONDITIONS IN WHICH MASS ATROCITIES CAN TAKE PLACE. I THINK THE RUSH TO SEND THIS\nSIGNAL OF UNWAVERING SUPPORT TO SIGNAL OF UNWAVERING SUPPORT TO ISRAEL, EVEN AS ALL OF THESE PEOPLE ARE BEING KILLED BY THIS BOMBARDMENT, IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW WE GOT HERE, IN THE SENSE THAT THIS IS A LONG-STANDING CONFLICT THAT'S SPANNED DECADES, VERY COMPLICATED. AND ALSO SOMETHING THAT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE, THE BORDERS OF ISRAEL OVER THE WEEKEND. WALK US THROUGH THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS UNFOLD NOTHING GAZA THAT'S ALSO A RESULT OF THAT. >> Reporter: I MEAN, THIS IS FIRST AND FOREMOST THE LACK OF A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE PALESTINIAN STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM, WHICH HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR DECADES. THIS DID NOT START THIS PAST WEEK, OF COURSE. ISRAEL HAS BEEN AT WAR AGAINST THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE SINCE THE ETHNIC CLEANSING OF PALESTINE IN 1948. UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE SEEN SO MANY ROUNDS OF THIS IN GAZA IN PARTICULAR. EACH TIME THE ISRAELI MILITARY LAUNCHES AND OPERATION, JUST TREMENDOUS DAMAGE, KILLING MANY PEOPLE, MOST OF THEM CIVILIANS. EACH TIME THEY SAY THEY WILL DO THIS, THERE HAVE BEEN 16 MILITARY OPERATIONS IN GAZA IN THE LAST 20 YEARS. EACH TIME THIS HAPPENS, THE FIGHTERS COME BACK WITH NOT JUST GREATER CAPABILITIES AND\nRESILIENCE, BUT ALSO RESILIENCE, BUT ALSO PALESTINIANS ARE INCREASINGLY SUPPORTIVE OF FIGHTING BACK. SO THIS WHOLE POLICY IS BANKRUPT, AND IT'S LED US TO THE SITUATION WHICH WE ARE IN TODAY. THERE IS NO MILITARY SOLUTION I THIS. THERE ARE MOTHERS WHO HAVE BEEN CRYING OVER THEIR BUTCHERED CHILDREN FOR YEARS, AND WE HAVE REFUSED TO HEAR THEIR CRIES AND REFUSED TO ADDRESS THEIR GRIEVANCES. THAT'S BROUGHT US TO THE MOMENT THAT WE ARE AT TODAY. IF THIS MOMENT IS GOING TO BE ANY DIFFERENT, IF WE GENUINELY CARE ON THE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND ON ALL SIDES OF THIS, THERE NEEDS TO BE A COMMITMENT TO ACTUALLY RESOLVE THE POLITICAL ISSUE HERE, OR ELSE WE ARE CONDEMNING EVERYBODY TO MORE ROUNDS OF THIS.

know right after World War II the Boomers they grew up and they uh their parents fought in World War II they fought the Nazis they were there helping rescue Jews from the Holocaust and so there was this um that was definitely talked about a lot more I think in schools it was definitely um something that that uh was a source of Pride for many Americans the fact that many of the parents fought in World War II so I think there's more of an affinity for Israel as this you know this is the one place where Jews can be safe this is a a a wonderful place that was given to Jews in order to for one as a form of reparations for the Holocaust even though I don't know why they didn't carve out part of Germany and say now this is yours but instead it was Israel and it was this here's your land and this is a reparations and you know we feel really terrible about what happened and so I think there was that Affinity that is definitely more P more um dominant in the older Generations but then the younger the generation gets and of course as time and history has gone on and there's been more and more reports of what's actually gone on to the native population of the land that Israel decided was going to be the land that they were going to take to create the home for Jews um the sentiment shifts as people get younger and younger so there was a lot of discussion about how are we going to get young people there and apparently some of the groups were offering $250 van Jones spoke at this rally now people might say well this is the truly peaceful rally we were seeing this on social media this is the truly peaceful rally we didn't see people um Pro genocide people here there people were peaceful they were waving some American flags uh didn't see people chanting and rioting like you saw even though I didn't really see riots necessarily with the pro Palestinian um certainly when you get a younger crowd you're going to probably get uh you know stuff's going to happen with a younger crowd versus an older crowd so um there was a lot of this comparison with these two rallies now these people many of them are clearly proar now some people say no they're not proar they're just pro Israel but watch this clip this is van Jones he made the mistake of suggesting Israel stop riging bombs on Gaza and in return the crowd chant at him no ceasefire watch this I'm a peace guy I pray for peace no more Rockets from Gaza and no more bombs falling down on the people of Gaza God protect the children God protect children let's end all the horror and all the Heartbreak in the Holy Land let's end all of this let's end all of it [Applause] but I'll be honest in [Music] closing when I think about what's happening over there I don't feel powerful to do something about what's happening over there what I do feel powerful is to maybe do something about what's happening here let's take a stand here against anti-jewish bigotry let's take take a stand against Muslim let's let's take a stand here against hatred let's take a stand here against hatred of all kinds I don't want well that crowd had a different idea so no ceasefire is what they were chanting there they want to continue the war they want to which I have a difficult time calling it a war I don't think that it's a war when you are a military a Soph phisticated armed military against a population that is really under your control and people will say well no Gaza is under homas control but that's not really true it's more like a neighborhood that Israel abandoned they were at once the they were at one point the occupiers of Gaza they then left Gaza they handed over the keys to to Hamas which was uh not really a truly functioning government it's become you know it it became one for a while there but then they didn't have elections there was a lot of Oppression of the Palestinian people inside of Gaza and um Israel controlled whether or not they gave the keys to Hamas it wasn't true sovereignty it wasn't true governance there was no ability for Hamas to control their borders their ports their airspace their water supply their electric electricity if you can't control the basics for your population then you're not actually a sovereignty it's based basically uh the government handing over the keys to a gang a neighborhood gang and saying all right we're we're out of here no police you know it's kind of the defund the police movement okay no police then here we're going to get out of here and instead we're just going to leave you guys to fend for yourselves and oh by the way we're not going to give you all the supplies that you need and we do and and we're we're going to give you minimal supplies and we're controlling all the supplies in and out so you can't really call it a war when the other side is not able to actually raise a military and a true military Hamas is they've got gorilla Urban warfare fighters so it's a it's a it's a military a true military against a gang of of Guerilla Warfare Urban Fighters and uh so it's not it's not a real war if it were a war there's certainly two sides in wars and a lot of times one side is much more Mighty and sophisticated than the other but I have a difficult I'm calling this a war it just seems really disproportionate and this one group of people is trapped and they're fundamentally under your control it's it doesn't feel quite like that but um but nonetheless a lot of people calling for continuing to bombard this trapped group of people continuing to bombard them and which is actually what we're seeing is a Slaughter thousands of people have died thousands more are buried alive under rubble and it's pretty atrocious and Van Jones is standing there saying well I don't think any innocent civilian should be killed and instead the crowd chants at him no ceasefire it's very hypocritical when many people were upset that people were not condemning Hamas or were not um feeling or showcasing Sympathy for the Israelis that were killed the Israeli civilians many people were absolutely caring about the civilians but of course there were some that that were not and then the criticism was well how dare you people but then in this and then they turn around and do this at at these rallies and chant no ceasefire and we don't essentially saying we don't care about these children who are being bombed to death well let

THE OFFENSIVE COINCIDES WITH  CIVILIANS FLEEING SOUTH IN  ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE THE VIOLENCE  THIS AS THE WHITE HOUSE  CONTINUES TO PUSH ITS HIGHLIGHT  ALLIES FOR A PAUSE.  >> IT'S TAKING LONGER THAN I  HOPED.  >> SABIA'S CONTRIBUTOR ROBERT  BERGER JOINS US.  >> TO BEGIN WITH, WE ARE GOING  TO HAVE FOUR HOUR PAUSES EACH  DAY IN TWO CORRIDORS.  THE IDEA IS TO ALLOW CIVILIANS  STILL IN NORTHERN GAZA, WHICH  IS THE MAIN AREA OF FIGHTING,  TO MOVE SOUTH, AND ACTUALLY  THESE HUMANITARIAN PAUSES HAVE  ALREADY BEEN  GOING ON  UNOFFICIALLY FOR THE PAST FEW  DAYS.  YESTERDAY FOR INSTANCE, THE UN  SAYS 50,000 PALESTINIANS MOVED,  WHICH IS SAFER.  THE IDEA IS TO GET PALESTINIAN  CIVILIANS OUT OF THE WAR ZONE,  SO THAT ISRAEL CAN ATTACK THE  HEADQUARTERS AND COMMAND  CENTERS OF HAMAS THERE IN GAZA  CITY, AND ALSO PERHAPS LOCATE  AND PERHAPS RESCUE SOME OF THE  HOSTAGES.  >> ROBERT, WE ARE ALSO SEEING  MORE BATTLES IN THE NORTH  BETWEEN IDF TROOPS AND  HEZBOLLAH.  TALK TO US ABOUT THE STATUS  THERE.  >> WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS PRETTY  MUCH DAILY SKIRMISHES WITH  HEZBOLLAH LAW, FIRING ROCKETS  OR ANTITANK MISSILES ACROSS THE  BORDER, AND ISRAEL RETALIATING  WITH AN ARTILLERY AND  AIRSTRIKES.  IT IS SORT OF LIKE A WAR, BUT  SKIRMISHES ON A LOW BURNER.  THIS COULD POSSIBLY ESCALATE.  RIGHT NOW IT'S AN ANNOYANCE FOR  ISRAEL, WITH THE DANGER OF A  POSSIBLE ESCALATION.  REMEMBER, HEZBOLLAH IS MUCH  MORE POWERFUL THAN HAMAS.  THEY HAVE 150,000 ROCKETS  POINTED AT ISRAEL. IT SEEMS  LIKE THEY RIGHT NOW, AND  ISRAEL, ARE TRYING TO KEEP THE  SKIRMISHES ON A LOW BURNER.  >> ON TOP OF THIS THERE HAS  BEEN AN INCREASE IN VIOLENCE IN  THE WEST BANK.  WHAT HAVE WE SEEN THERE?  >> ISRAELIS ARE GOING AFTER  HAMAS IN THE WEST BANK.  BECAUSE THEY FEAR BASICALLY  THAT A MASSACRE LIKE WHAT  HAPPENED ON OCTOBER 7th, COULD  NOW HAPPEN WITH HAMAS MILITANTS  IN THE WEST BANK.  SO THEY CARRIED THAT GRADE ON  THE REFUGEE CAMP, AND ACCORDING  TO PALESTINIAN OFFICIALS, SEVEN  GUNMEN, AND THIS HAS BEEN GOING  ON NOW PRETTY MUCH SINCE  OCTOBER 7th.  HUNDREDS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED,  MAYBE 800, 900 PALESTINIANS  ARRESTED, MEMBERS OF MILITANT  GROUPS ACCORDING TO THE ISRAELI  MILITARY, AND ALSO DOZENS HAVE  BEEN KILLED BY ISRAELI FORCES.  ISRAEL IS BASICALLY USING THE  FOCUS ON GAZA TO ALSO GO AFTER  THE MILITANTS THERE IN THE WEST  BANK.  >> ROBERT BERGER, THANK YOU.  >>> NORTHERN GAZA HAS NOT SEEN  A LETUP IN THE FIGHTING.  SOME AREAS IN THE SOUTH HAVE  ALSO BEEN HIT WITH ISRAELI  AIRSTRIKES.  >> PRODUCER FOR CBS WAS NEARBY  ONE OF THOSE AIRSTRIKES.  >> Reporter: I WAS COVERING THE  SUFFERING OF THE DISPLACED  PEOPLE, AND CAMERA FOR THE  SANDUP, SUDDENLY A MASSIVE  AIRSTRIKE HIT THIS HOUSE,  CONSISTING OF THREE FLOORS,  FULL OF CIVILIANS WHO DISPLACED  FROM NORTH TO SOUTH.

THEY WILL HAVE SOME CHOICES TO  MAKE.  IF THEY CONTINUE TO CHOOSE TO  HIT OUR TROOPS, IF THEY  CONTINUE TO LAUNCH THESE DRONE  ATTACKS, WE WILL DO WHAT WE  NEED TO DO TO PROTECT  OURSELVES.  >> NATALIE BRAND JOINS US NOW  FROM OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE.  WHAT MORE ARE WE LEARNING ABOUT  THIS STRIKE?  >> Reporter: HEY, LANA AND  NANCY.  THE TARGET OF THIS LATEST U.S.  STRIKE  WAS A WEAPONS STORAGE  FACILITY USED BY IRAN'S  REVOLUTIONARY GUARD.  THE U.S., GOING AFTER STORAGE  SITES FOR MUNITIONS THAT COULD  BE LINKED TO THIS SERIES OF  ATTACKS AGAINST U.S. PERSONNEL.  YOU MENTIONED THERE HAVE BEEN  MORE THAN 40 SINCE OCTOBER 7th.  17 RATHER, EXCUSE ME, AND A  SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL TELLING  REPORTERS LAST NIGHT THAT WE  HOLD IRAN, THE U.S. HOLD IRAN  ACCOUNTABLE FOR THESE ATTACKS,  NOT JUST THE MILITIA GROUPS, SO  THAT THE STRIKES THAT WERE  TAKEN ARE TARGETING THIS  SPECIFIC FACILITY USED BY THE  REVOLUTIONARY GUARD, ALONG WITH  THOSE MILITIA GROUPS BACKED BY  IRAN.  >> GIVEN THAT, NATALIE, DOES  THE WHITE HOUSE CONSIDER THIS A  SUCCESS?  >> PRESIDENT BIDEN WAS ASKED  ABOUT THAT THIS MORNING WHEN  LEAVING FOR THE WHITE HOUSE.  HE SAID YES, IN THE SENSE THAT  THEY ARE HITTING THE TARGETS.  HE WAS ASKED WHETHER MOORE  STRIKES COULD BE TAKEN, WILL  THE U.S. HIT THOSE FACILITIES  AGAIN.  HE SAID IF THEY STRIKE US,  THAT'S A MESSAGE THAT HAS BEEN  REITERATED BY THE  ADMINISTRATION THAT THE U.S.  WILL DEFEND ITS FORCES AND  PERSONNEL, WHILE AT THE SAME  TIME, DOING EVERYTHING IT CAN  TO PREVENT THE SITUATION FROM  ESCALATING TO THE SECRETARY OF  STATE AND THE PRESIDENT HAVE  MADE CLEAR WE DO NOT WANT  CONFLICT WITH IRAN.  AGAIN, CONCERTED EFFORTS TO  KEEP US FROM GOING, BUT AT THE  SAME TIME, MAKING IT CLEAR THAT  STEPS WILL BE TAKEN IF THESE  ATTACKS CONTINUE.  >> NATALIE, I WANT TO UNPACK  THIS, BECAUSE IT CAN BE  CONFUSING FOR VIEWERS THAT WHAT  WAS HAPPENING HERE WAS IRANIAN- BACKED MILITANTS WHO ARE TRYING  TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE  SITUATION.  IN THIS CASE, THEY HAD A  WAREHOUSE OF WEAPONS AND SYRIA.  WE HAVE ALSO SEEN IRAN-BACKED  MILITIAS OR TERRORIST  ORGANIZATIONS TRYING TO TAKE  ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION.  WE EXPECT WE WILL SEE THE  UNITED STATES CONTINUE TO TAKE  ACTION?  ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS HAPPENING  IN OTHER COUNTRIES, LIKE SYRIA,  IRAQ, BUT IT'S ALL KIND OF UP  PROXY FOR IRAN AND THEIR  BACKING OF THESE GROUPS?  >> Reporter: RIGHT.  THIS ALL COMES AMID THE BACKDROP OF THE LARGER CONFLICT PLAYING  OUT IN THE REGION, IN THE  MIDDLE EAST, THE WAR BETWEEN  ISRAEL AND HAMAS, AND THESE  ESCALATIONS, THESE ATTACKS DID  RAMP UP FOLLOWING THAT  CONFLICT, BEGINNING AT THE SAME  TIME, THE PENTAGON SAYING THIS  IS SEPARATE, OR AFTER THAT  FIRST STRIKE SAYING THE U.S.  STRIKES ARE SEPARATE, AND APART  FROM THAT, SENDING A CLEAR  MESSAGE TO IRAN TO STOP THIS  BEHAVIOR AND STOP THE CONFLICT  FROM WIDENING.  BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT  AROUND HALF OF THE ATTACKS THAT  HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCED SO FAR  AGAINST U.S. TROOPS ACTUALLY  HAPPENED AFTER THE FIRST U.S.  AIRSTRIKE.  SO THEY CLEARLY DIDN'T GET THE  MESSAGE THE FIRST TIME.

you say something against Israel now it's just you're supporting you're a baby killer after a ghastly terrorist attack on Israel that triggered a war with Hamas this week the reverberations of the crisis are being felt and heard loudly back on American soil Police Department from coast to coast are on heightened alert after a former Hamas Chief reportedly calling for a day of rage on Friday the NYPD ramping up security canceling vacations and putting all officers on duty and Columbia University closing their campus to the public today ahead of a planned event just one day after police said an Israeli was beaten outside of the library we know that incidents in the Middle East violence tends to spark acts of hate here at at home we've seen a 400 plus% increase in incidents this week versus this week last year some say Harvard University becoming a microcosm this week for the fears and pain Unleashed across the country on Saturday more than 30 student groups on campus sparked outrage after releasing a letter that said the Israeli regime is quote entirely responsible for all unfolding violence the statement went on to say that the conflict did not occur in a vacuum blaming the conditions palestin Indians have been forced to live in for decades the university is ramping up security including here outside of Harvard H which is the center of Jewish life on campus it's been really hard to get people to speak on camera because they tell me they just don't feel safe speaking out what was your reaction when you first saw it I was appalled when I saw that letter you know when um people are when civilians are being murdered and women are being raped and kids and Holocaust Survivors are being kidnapped and held hostage the last thing you do the absolute last thing you do is you want the victim Jacob Miller is the president of Harvard hell he says the lack of support from some of his fellow students and what some saw as the school's initial tepid response has been hurtful Jews are aching um I know Jewish students feel unsafe and they feel uncomfortable and they feel betrayed and I I I I I honestly don't know like how are we going to heal as a campus how are we going to move on the Palestinian solidarity committee later put out a statement saying in part PSC staunchly opposes all VI against all innocent life and laments all human suffering Palestinian students I spoke with said they are scared to speak up campus or even mourn their lost loved ones which is why they aren't showing their faces I can't be alone because I feel like I'm dying imagine feeling like the place that you're from is going to get wiped off the map I think that if I show my face or say something again Israel is at this time I just the attacks are just will be overwhelming how are your family members doing I just got a message from my grandmother just letting me know that 10 members of our family had been killed some students say they were completely blindsided when their organization signed the letter I do know that there's a lot of people who didn't really know about it didn't read it and then now they're caught kind of caught in the middle Harvard's leadership came under Fire for not immediately issuing a response to the letter and then releasing a statement some say was is not strong enough a day later Harvard president Claudine gay ultimately writing I condemn the terrorist atrocities perpetrated by Hamas distancing the University from the student signatories so something that's caused a lot of controversy lately of course has been the letter that was signed by more than 30 student groups I think that the outrage that has um that that statement has sparked um is intentional it's intentional to um intimidate um Palestinians and their allies into Silence about speaking truth to power we feel that we can just get cancelled because we said something against Israel this doesn't even make sense like we are are in the Academia in Harvard we're supposed to be able to speak about what is happening and even debate about it while no acts of violence have been reported on Harvard's campus this week the animosity is palpable this is disgusting this is sickening driving around Harvard's campus today a SoCal doxing truck displaying the names and faces of students allegedly linked to the letter I don't feel safe going to campus and we have friends who receive death threats whose numbers are out there who are getting constant constant calls uh from unknown numbers I don't think doxing is appropriate under any circumstances I do think people need to be accountable for their words and so if these students feel like these student organizations signed an oped that was not in their name they should write publicly and say this was not in my name already several CEO are asking for all the students involved in the letter at Harvard to be identified so they can be quote blacklisted for future jobs another vocal critic of the letter is former treasury secretary and past Harvard president Larry Summers speaking Wednesday on Bloomberg News the statement by 30 student groups uh blaming all violence on Israel was a moral absurdity and then tweeting a request for cooler heads to Prevail saying in part many in these groups never saw the statement before it went out in some cases those approving did not understand exactly what they were approving probably some were naive and foolish this is not a time where it is constructive to vilify individuals and I am sorry that is happening Harvard isn't the only School struggling with pressure to take a stand Wall Street CEO Mark Rowan is calling for leaders at the University of Pennsylvania to resign and donors to close their checkbooks over an alleged failure to condemn anti-Semitism and Hate and an NYU Law School student lost a job offer at a top Law Firm after saying Israel bore full responsibility for the loss of life late this evening Harvard's president gay releasing a new video statement saying the school rejects terrorism hate harassment and intimidation of people based on their beliefs our University Embraces a commitment to free expression that commitment extends even to views that many of us find objectionable even outrageous we do not punish or sanction people for expressing such views but that is a far cry for endorsing them let's be

from Iran today there hasn't been any official reaction from Iranian government spokesperson or any other high ranking officials here in the capital tan but I I think it's going to come very soon this is going to be seen as a huge victory for not only the Palestinian uh cause but also for the Iranian uh government and system which has been behind the Palestinian cause since the very uh beginning of the formation of the state of Israel and the Islamic revolution of 1979 we've heard from the Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali last Tuesday where he h spoke at length about the uh plight of the Palestinian people and I think his words are very very um reflective of the events we've seen on fold today in Gaza and in uh Israel as well com said that they are um the countries that were establishing ties with Israel are betting on a losing horse he also said that the Palestinian movement is more uh alive than it has ever been during the past 70 to 80 years and that the movement will achieve its goals uh he also has said that uh Israel is a cancer that needs to be eradicated at the hands of the Palestinian people and the resistance forces in the region I think it's important to highlight Iran has always supported uh groups such as Islamic Jihad and Hamas not only when it comes to the um belief uh ideological belief that they have about their own existence in in Palestine but also when it comes to supplying them with whatever they need now unofficially they've never admitted that they Supply weapons or funding to those groups but it is believed that that is usually uh what happens uh especially as well to groups like um Hezbollah in Lebanon as well so there is a very strong relationship between Iran and those groups uh in Palestine and this is going to be seen as a victory for not only the Palestinian um resistant movement but also for the Iranian officials I guess the question is how much more support are they willing to give is it just going to be words or is there going to be action I mean we've actually heard a call for arms from the alassan Brigade this morning uh you know what what is going to be the thinking in Iran about that well uh usually when Iran unveils just to give you an idea a new missile of any kind they always make a point uh to reference how long their missiles would take to reach Tel Aviv from tan the last time we saw this happen was in June when Iran unveiled its first ever Hypersonic ballistic missile uh and uh they said that that it would take six minutes for it to reach Tel Aviv from tan a warning to Israel that they have uh said over and over again with each unveiling of these missiles now officially Iran has not admitted that they are selling or providing these uh missiles to uh the groups the resistance groups in uh Palestine but uh I think uh many believe that that is the case whether or not they'll publicly admit it will remain to be seen there is a United Nations security Council uh resolution that is due to be lifted on October 18th where any limitation on Iran selling its uh Advanced missile technology and Military technology to any country uh is going to be lifted completely so they will not have any restrictions whether that will be a factor in uh Iranian officials admitting that they're selling their U missiles to uh groups in uh Palestine uh we'll have to see but just to give you an idea the number of missiles that we saw launched today from Gaza 2,200 of them about just about uh is a huge number in comparison to uh the last war the Gaza War we saw in 2014 where that lasted for 50 days and during the 50 days we saw about uh 4,500 or so uh Rockets being launched by the resistant movements uh in Gaza so there is a huge increase in the number of uh missiles that they have in their Arsenal and it's going to be a very important question that the International Community will certainly have for Iranian officials whether or not they've been providing it and whether or not they will admit to it or not but one thing is certain when it comes to providing support to the Palestinian people from the very top of the system here from the supreme leader himself Ali k h they he has said over and over again that they Iranians will do anything they can to help their resistance and to free the Palestinian people and to get rid of the occupiers in um their on their land now what that means they never specify but we'll have to wait and see tosa Jabari there first in tan"}, "Pa1Z4NFxFwc": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa1Z4NFxFwc", "video_id": "Pa1Z4NFxFwc",

with the uh view that Duro holds here um on a more specific level about these latest devastating developments that we've seen go down over the last few days I think the most important thing is that the loss of life particularly of civilians and both Israeli and Palestinian civilians is regrettable and and it's also unavoidable I'll expand on the unavoidable part a bit um you know we believe that while the attack may have been the the the the the the the the scale of the attack is surprising the fact that an attack has taken place is not that surprising um you know given the event of the last year the cruelty the inhumanity violence against civilians the repression all that accompanies um an illegal occupation that has been taking place for close to you know five decades um if not more has led many to believe that given the lack of accountability and the lack of voice from Palestinians that some kind of um Counterattack would be would be imminent that being said um we we don't think that any form of violence irrespective of the justification for it is in the interest of the Palestinians or the Israelis at this stage and this is why we're calling for immediate ation for an immediate ceasefire so as to spare more civilians from being killed unnecessarily um this would necessitate the International Community ensuring that the Israelis and the Palestinians come together for Meaningful talks towards a just and peace a just solution um to to the occupation and I want to underscore you know the word just just does mean that the occupation must end it does mean that the annexation of land through the use of force must end it does mean that the final status issues must be agreed on they've been being discussed and debated for decades that includes the rate of return the status of East Jerusalem um and many many other similar factors that unless these issues are dealt with and dealt with speedily you'll always have conflict I mean the fact that you've had an occupation for so many decades means that there's always um occupation as I as we say is not an accusation it's a statement of fact the icj has ruled on this the fact that you have a occupation does mean that you have a a a a violent conflict there it's just that you know um the the severity of that conflict um differs over time with some very short interum of Peace but there is never um a a just piece or um an end until the occupation ends yeah AB position that yes and my apologies for coming in there DG but um um it's absolutely important point that you raised there that despite whatever is happening on the ground any level of violence is absolutely unacceptable so in calling for that immediate intervention that you have called for the ceasefire peace negotiations if South Africa were asked as part to be part of uh an international uh stakeholder base to engage the parties invol involved in this conflict would South Africa participate and how exactly would South Africa negot um navigate those negotiations uh to find a sustainable peaceful Solutions um in both regions Africa if if we are asked to to be part of any solution we would we would we would be most um we would happily oblig um but we we know that an initiative like this will require many ERS it will require South Africa Egypt at the at the very least it will require the US um but we feel that at this stage given the Dynamics of the last year and given the Dynamics even with previous peace talks and the failures um of these peace talks when they were led by what was called the quad which includes the US um um and and Egypt amongst others that we need the UN to play a more Cal and meaningful role to convene these discussions convene these negot iations put in place a road map um towards achieving this just and Lasting piece you know as I stated that we need this road map um that will deal with you know what territory is it the 1967 borders that will give rise to a two-state solution which is part of the international um you know configuration at at the moment but um as many many analysts have pointed out that the Israeli government has imperiled the two-state solution so some are talking about a one-state solution where founded on the basis of the human rights of all who are legally um um will have the legal status to live in in in the territory um but that being said we the Israelis and and the Palestinians must Define that we will play a facilitative role we will work with other role players and we will bring to the four the experience that violence um is never a solution that dialogue and diplomacy he's always a solution um that being said we also recognize that repression will always give rise to forms of resistance and resistance um in some cases may be violent um and we want to avoid all forms of violence so we will we will we will will work with whatever stakeholders are called to to facilitate these talks and we will try and bring in the UN as a central player thank you very much for that update DJ and of course we will continue to engage you over the coming days because uh even though uh there is that conflict that has um infringed on the rights and the human rights of some people there uh any form of violence is unacceptable um and of course as we've seen over the last few days the loss of life there as well that is durco director General Zan Dango

about to give a news conference his first news conference if he takes questions of course since the October 7th attacks let's listen it humanitarian crisis it is a crisis of humanity the intensifying conflict is shaking the world rattling the region and most tragically destroying so many innocent lives ground operations by the Israel Defense Forces and Contin bombardment are hitting civilians hospitals refugee camps mosques church and un facilities including shelters No One Is Safe at the same time Hamas and other militants use civilians as human Shields and continue to launch rockets indiscriminately towards Israel I reiterate my utter condemnation of the abhorent acts of Terror perpet ated by Hamas on 7 October and repeat my call for the immediate unconditional and safe release of hostages held in Gaza nothing can justify the deliberate torture killing injuring and kidnapping of civilians the protection of civilians must be Paramount I'm deeply concerned about clear violations of international humanitarian law that we are witnessing let me be clear no party to an armed conflict is above International humanitarian law ladies and gentlemen of the press Gaza is becoming a graveyard for children hundreds of girls and boys are reportedly being killed or injured every day more journalists have reportedly been killed over a 4-week period than in any conflict in at least three decades more United Nations Aid workers have been killed than in any comparable period in the history of our organization I salute all those who continue their life-saving work despite the overwhelming challenges and risks and the unfolding catastrophe makes the need for a humanitarian ceasefire more urgent with every passing hour the parties to the conflict and indeed International Community face an immediate and fundamental responsibility to stop the inhuman Collective suffering and dramatically expand humanitarian Aid to Gaza today the United Nations and our partners are launching a1.2 billion US doar humanitarian appeal to help 2.7 million people that's the entire population of the Gaza Strip and half a million Palestinians in the West Bank including East Jerusalem some life-saving Aid is getting into Gaza from Egypt through the Raa Crossing but the trickle of assistance does not me the ocean of need and let's be clear the r Crossing alone does not have the capacity to process eight trucks at the scale required just over 400 tracks have crossed into Gaza over the past two weeks compared with 500 a day before the conflict and crucially this does not include fuel without fuel newborn babies in incubators and patients on life support will die water cannot be pumped or purified raw sewage could soon start gashing onto the streets further spreading disease trucks loaded with critical relief will be stranded The Way Forward is clear a humanitarian C fire now all parties respecting all their obligations and international humanitarian law now this means the unconditional release of the hostages in Gaza now the protection of civilians hospitals un facilities shelters and schools now more food more water more medicine and of course fool entering Gaza safely swiftly and at the needed now and fed access to deliver supplies to all people in need in Gaza now and the end of the use of civilians as human Shields now none of these appeals should be conditional on the others and for all of these we need more funding now in addition I remain Gravely concerned about Rising violence and an expansion of the conflict the occupied West Bank including East Jerusalem is at a boiling point let us also not forget the importance of addressing the risks of the conflict spilling over to the wider region we are already witnessing a spiral of escalation from Lebanon and Syria to Iraq and Yemen that escalation must stop cool heads and diplomatic efforts must Prevail hateful rhetoric and provocative actions must cease I am deeply troubled by the rise in anti-Semitism and anti-muslim bigotry Jewish and Muslim communities in many parts of the world are on high alert fearing for their personal Safety and Security emotions are at a fever pitch tensions are running High and the images of suffering are heartbreaking and soul crushing but we must find a way to all hold on to our common Humanity I think of civilians in Gaza the vast majority women and children terrified by the Relentless bombardment I joined the UN family in mourning 89 of our unra colleagues who have been killed in Gaza many of them together with members of their family they include teachers School principles doctors Engineers guards support staff and a young woman named Mai Mai did not let her muscular distrophy or her wheelchair conf find her dreams she was a top student became a software developer and devoted her skills to working on information technology for unra I am so deeply inspired by her example and I think of all those tortured and killed in Israel nearly when months ago and the hostages abducted from their homes their families their friends while simply living their lives 10 days ago I met with some of the family members of those hostages I heard their stories felt their anguish and was deeply moved by their compassion I will never relent in working for their immediate release this is essential in itself and Central to solving many other challenges one mother movingly movingly shared with me a desolation over her abducted son H she also spoke outside the security Council and on the subject of confronting hatred she said and I quote when you only get outraged when one side's babies are killed then your moral compass is broken and your humanity is broken end quote even in her hotter despair she stood before the world and reminded us and I quote in a competition of pain there is never a winner end quote we must act now to find a way out of this brutal awful agonizing dead end of Destruction to help end the pain and suffering to help heal the broken and to help pave the way to peace to a two-state Solutions with Israelis and Palestinians living in peace and security thank you you very much [Music] sir all right the United Nations Secretary General speaking in New York to reporters there we were hoping that he would take questions from the reporters there but he hasn't it's his uh spokesman who will be uh doing that uh a little later I think Stefan dejar at the podium Antonio guz speaking to reporters for the first time since the October the 7th attack uh by Hamas on Israel and uh his uh statement there coming on the day that the death toll of Palestinians killed in the Israeli attacks on Gaza reached the green Milestone of 10,000 a statement also coming as Israel's bombing campaign as you can see on those live pictures from Gaza are continuing intense bombing of Gaza City in the last few minutes as the United Nation Secretary General was making that statement it was a pretty strong statement uh the language used by Antonio guz very strong he said Gaza is becoming a graveyard for Palestinian children hundreds of girls and boys reportedly being killed or injured every day he announced also that the United Nations and its partners are launching a $1.2 billion humanitarian appeal to help the 2.7 million people in Gaza and uh also half a million Palestinians in the occupied West West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem uh a number of things that the United Nations Secretary General talked about there which were going to discuss now with our diplomatic editor James spay who's here on the set with us uh as I said James a pretty strong statement from the United Nations Secretary General coming on what is an important day today with this 10 10,000 death toll uh uh in in Gaza of Palestinians killed in Israeli air strikes what did you make of what he had to say and what stood out the most for you crisis of humanity was one of his first words and he was very very clear who was responsible saying that it was the ground operations of the Israeli Defense Force and the continued bombardment but are hitting civilians hospitals refugee camps mosks churches and um and un facilities um it is interesting though that this speech was very balanced there was quite a lot about what happened on October the 7th remember the criticism he got when he spoke the security ccil from the Israelis right from the Israeli the Israeli Ambassador calling for his resignation that's because he said what happened on October the 7th didn't happen in a vacuum and there was a context to it got a great deal of criticism and interesting that there was nothing really about the historical context uh in this speech and he has to be very measured um and has to remember that he has an Israeli audience as well because he is the man uh in his job as the as the Secretary General of the United Nations who might have to try and negotiated some sort of peace that puts him in a difficult position when you also hear him saying uh that he mn's 88 un colleagues who've been killed in Gaza because he's their employer he has a duty of care if you were the employer of 88 people who are killed you'd want to start raging at the person responsible for killing them which of course is Israel right a strong but measured speech as you said he also talked about Aid which is crucial right now for Gaza he said some life- saving Aid is getting into Gaza from Egypt through the Rafa Crossing it's not enough he said he says the Rafa Crossing alone does not have the capacity to process a trucks at the scale required so there is uh there is the um another Crossing of course that he's alluding to here are we likely to see any progress on more Aid getting into Gaza not just s Rafa but through the uh other Crossing yeah it's it's a hint but it's not one I've heard him make publicly before that Israel should open up Kum Shalom I'm sure privately they've been saying that to the Israelis all the way through this Kim shuram is a much bigger um uh deal uh it is where most of the trucks used to go in from Israel directly into Gaza and it's been completely closed since October the 7th saying that Rafer alone doesn't have the capacity there is no other Crossing from Egypt so you'd have to have a Crossing from Israel it seems that he's talking about that publicly the other thing he's talking about on Aid publicly is about fuel of course that's the one thing even though some trucks have gone in nowhere near enough according to the Secretary General just over 400 uh trucks um no no fuel has gone in and he made it clear that that means newborn babies and people on life support care um people on dialysis they going to die briefly James uh there's a security council meeting later a closed door security council meeting what can we expect from that well I think there'll be more uh discussion of the current situation and and and and more disagreement and impass in the security Council I think they'll be hoping that a closed door meeting the security Council will also perhaps give some impetus to negotiations because remember the security Council hasn't been able to pass a res ution in over a month uh on this particular issue the argument at the moment is if you have a resolution does it have the word seesar in it or does it have the word humanitarian Paws you've got currently both the US and Russia prepare to use their veto over those words I'll pause you there James B is our diplomatic editor thank you very much"}, "1Y225jzhiN8": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y225jzhiN8",

LEILA: PACKING UP AND SHIPPING OUT. ISRAEL CONTINUES CALLING UP ARMY RESERVISTS BY THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS TO FIGHT WHAT IT PROMISES WILL BE A DEVASTATING RETALIATORY WAR AGAINST HAMAS. SINCE YESTERDAY WE'VE SEEN PREPARATIONS FOR THIS CONFLICT START TO ROLL OUT ON A MASSIVE SCALE, TANKS AND ARTILLERY ROLLING DOWN THE HIGHWAY, ON CIVILIAN TRAILERS COMMANDEERED BY THE ARMY, IN THEIR THOUSANDS. THEY'RE GOING TO AMASS ON THE SOUTHERN GAZA BORDER, PUTTING ON A HUGE SHOW OF FORCE AS THEY PREPARE FOR AN ALMIGHTY BATTLE. ALL THOSE VEHICLES, AND SOLDIERS, NEED FUEL TO RUN ON. YAARIT USUALLY MANAGES THIS GAS STATION ON THE SOUTHERN HIGHWAY. IT HAS BEEN CLOSED SINCE THE ATTACKS, LIKE OTHER SHOPS AND RESTAURANTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, WITH ALL ITS STAFF CALLED UP TO FIGHT. THERE'S NO ONE TO WORK. SO SHE'S COME TO STAFF THE CHECKOUT COUNTER AND KEEP IT OPEN. SEVERAL OF YAARIT'S FRIENDS WERE MURDERED IN THE ATTACKS.

THERE'S THE LIFE WE LIVED BEFORE, AND THE LIFE THAT WE LIVE NOW AFTER WHAT HAPPENED. LEILA: AS BUS AFTER BUS OF SOLDIERS ROLLS PAST ON ITS WAY TO THE FRONT LINE, THEY STEEL THEMSELVES FOR WHAT AWAITS. HAVING BEATEN BACK HUNDREDS OF HAMAS FIGHTERS AFTER A LONG, BRUTAL FIGHT ON THE BORDER WITH GAZA, AS IS REALLY SOLDIERS -- AS ISRAELI SOLDIERS CARRIED OUT THE GRIM JOB OF CLEARING VICTIMS HOMES, THEY FOUND A NEW SOURCE OF TERROR. IN THE VILLAGES THAT WERE ATTACKED BY HAMAS ON SATURDAY, THE ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCE FOUND A HUGE CACHE OF WEAPONRY, THOUSANDS OF PIECES, AND THEY SUSPECT THAT HAMAS PLANNED A MUCH LONGER FIGHT. SCATTERED AMIDST THE CARNAGE -- HAND GRENADES; ANTI-TANK MINES; ARTILLERY ROUNDS; NORTH KOREAN-MANUFACTURED ROCKET PROPELLED GRENADES; IMPROVISED ROCKET LAUNCHERS. AND, VITALLY, IRANIAN-MADE MORTAR ROUNDS, THE FIRST MATERIAL EVIDENCE THAT IRAN IS DIRECTLY SUPPLYING WEAPONRY TO HAMAS IN THIS FIGHT. >> THIS IS MADE IN IRAN, NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. WE KNEW THEY HAD MORTARS, BUT THESE IRANIAN MORTARS, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE SEEN THEM IN THIS BATTLE. LEILA: IT'S TAKEN BOMB SQUADS MORE THAN A WEEK TO SAFELY DISARM ALL THESE MUNITIONS. AND NOW HERE THEY SIT, DEEP IN AN ISRAELI BASE, A TESTAMENT TO THE SHEER SCALE OF THE FIREPOWER HAMAS HAS STOCKPILED. AS ISRAEL PLANS ITS ATTACK ON THE MILES-LONG NETWORK OF HAMAS TUNNELS THAT LIE BENEATH GAZA, ITS SOLDIERS CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW MUCH MORE AWAITS THEM THERE. BUT SITTING ABOVE THOSE WEAPON-STACKED TUNNELS ARE DEFENSELESS CIVILIANS. FOR DAYS, CROWDS OF PALESTINIAN DUAL NATIONALS HAVE WAITED ANXIOUSLY AT THE RAFAH BORDER CROSSING WITH EGYPT. WITH GAZA UNDER CONSTANT BOMBARDMENT AND UNDER SIEGE, THIS IS THEIR ONLY ESCAPE ROUTE. JOURNALIST QASSEM AL-KATHARNA HOLDS AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP.

BUT IT WAS SHUT DOWN NEARLY A WEEK AGO AFTER BEING HIT BY AN ISRAELI AIR STRIKE. SINCE THEN, NO ONE HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO LEAVE, AND DESPERATELY NEEDED HUMANITARIAN AID HAS STOPPED TRICKLING IN. U.S. OFFICIALS HOPED THE CROSSING WOULD OPEN TODAY FOR A FEW HOURS, BUT TALKS WITH ISRAEL AND EGYPT TO REOPEN RAFAH HAVE SO FAR FAILED. SAMEH SHOUKRY IS EGYPT'S FOREIGN MINISTER. MIN. SHOUKRY: THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT HAS NOT TAKEN A DECISION THAT LEADS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF OPENING THE RAFAH BORDER CROSSING FROM GAZA'S SIDE . LEILA: A FEW MILES NORTH OF RAFAH, IN THE CITY OF KHAN YOUNIS, THERE IS NO LET UP IN THE ISRAELI BOMBARDMENT. BEFORE THE WAR THE CITY WAS HOME TO ABOUT 400,000 PALESTINIANS. NOW MORE THAN 1 MILLION AFTER ISRAEL ORDERED PEOPLE TO EVACUATE SOUTH. WITH HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS DISPLACED, A FAST-GROWING HUMANITARIAN CRISIS HAS ERUPTED. THESE MEN DO WHAT THEY CAN TO FEED FELLOW CIVILIANS. WITH NO FUEL LEFT THANKS TO THE BLOCKADE, THEY COOK WITH FIREWOOD. MOHAMMED: THERE IS NO STOVE, AND WE BARELY CAN FIND FIREWOOD. I KEPT TELLING PEOPLE THEY HAVE TO WAIT TO EAT. LEILA: AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, SECRETARY OF STATE ANTONY BLINKEN WAS BACK IN ISRAEL TODAY AFTER MEETING WITH LEADERS ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST TO TRY AND STOP THE CONFLICT SPREADING THROUGH THE REGION. BUT SPEAKING TO ISRAEL'S DEFENSE MINISTER YOAV GALLANT TODAY, HE EMPHASIZED U.S. SUPPORT WAS ROCK-SOLID. SEC. BLINKEN: YOU KNOW OUR DEEP COMMITMENT TO ISRAEL'S RIGHT AND INDEED ITS OBLIGATION TO DEFEND ITSELF AND TO DEFEND ITS PEOPLE. LEILA: TENSIONS ARE HIGH ON THE ISRAELI BORDER WITH LEBANON.

PM NETANYAHU: I HAVE MESSAGE TO IRAN AND HEZBOLLAH DON'T TEST US ON NORTHERN BORDER. DON'T GET BACK TO THE MISTAKE THAT YOU DID ONCE. BECAUSE TODAY THE PRICE THAT YOU WILL PAY WILL BE MORE EXPENSIVE. LEILA: AS VIOLENCE ESCALATES, THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS BEGAN EVACUATING AMERICAN CITIZENS FROM ISRAEL BY SEA. THAT VIOLENCE IS ESCALATING FAST. TODAY SAW HUNDREDS MORE ROCKETS FALL ON BOTH SIDES OF THE GAZA BORDER AND EXCHANGES OF FIRE ACROSS THE NORTHERN BORDER WITH LEBANON EVEN AS IRAN WARNED THE COUNTRY MIGHT RETALIATE AGAINST ISRAEL EVEN BEFORE AN INVASION OF GAZA. GEOFF: YOU WERE NEAR GAZA TODAY, GIVE US AN IDEA OF WHAT THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE ISRAELI GROUND INVASIONS LOOK LIKE. LEILA: A STAGGERING AMOUNT OF ARMOR AND ARTILLERY SHIPPED. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SOLDIERS CALLED UP, WALKING DOWN THE HIGHWAY WITH PACKS, JUMPING INTO JEEPS, SHIPPED TWO DIFFERENT BORDER POSTS. ALSO EVACUATIONS BECAUSE THESE AREAS HAVE ALREADY BEEN HIT WITH SO MANY ROCKETS AND NOW THERE WILL BE A FULL-SCALE WAR AND THEY NEED TO GET PEOPLE OUT. SOME PEOPLE WILLING TO GO, SOME PEOPLE DESPERATE TO STAY, SAYING WHERE WILL I GO? GEOFF: WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS FOR GAZA AND THE PEOPLE TRYING TO ESCAPE? LEILA: THERE ARE TWO ISSUES HERE, THE FIRST IS WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW WITH THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS BREWING IN THE SOUTH OF GAZA. PEOPLE WERE TOLD THEY HAD TO MOVE TO THE SOUTH OF GAZA, THAT'S WHERE THEY WOULD BE SAFE. EVEN AS THEY STARTED TO MOVE A COUPLE DAYS AGO, CONVOYS WERE HIT ON THE ROAD AS FAMILIES TRY TO FLEE. THEY WERE TOLD TO GO TO THE SOUTH AND THAT THERE WOULD BE A HUMANITARIAN ZONE. THEY APPROACHED IT AND THERE WAS A STRIKE ON THE RAFAH CROSSING. NOW THE HOSPITAL THERE HAS TAKEN A HIT. THIS IS NOT SUSTAINABLE, THEY NEED TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE THESE PEOPLE SAFE AND FIND SOMEWHERE THEY CAN GO AND STAY THERE. THE NEXT ISSUE IS WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE IS A FULL GROUND INVASION? CURRENTLY IN JEPSON'S SAVE -- EGYPTIANS SAY NO WAY THEY WILL OPEN THE CROSSING FOR EVERYONE, ONLY FOR NATIONALS. THAT HASN'T HAPPENED YET. IF THEY CAN GET PALESTINIANS WITH FOREIGN PASSPORTS OUT THAT WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION, THOUSANDS COULD GET TO SAFETY. CAN THEY BUILD A HUGE REFUGEE CAMP AROUND THE CROSSING? EGYPT WOULD HAVE TO AGREE, THE UN WOULD HAVE TO GET INVOLVED. THERE ARE ALREADY HALF A MILLION PALESTINIANS LIVING IN REFUGEE CAMPS AND THEY DON'T WANT ANOTHER ONE. FINALLY, THE ACCIDENTAL -- EXISTENTIAL ISSUE, PEOPLE ARE WORRIED THAT IF PEOPLE LEAVE GAZA, THEY WILL NEVER BE ALLOWED TO COME BACK AND THEY WILL LOSE THEIR LAND AND THEY ARE TERRIFIED.

the air strike until one hit their borrowed apartment at 4 this morning I've lost my father my brother my uncle two cousins two other family members and my pregnant wife I'm the only Survivor he said we've done nothing Israel insists Hamas is to blame for the suffering of Palestinians but accusations that Israel is answering the war crimes of Hamas with ones of its own have started back in Israel videos are still emerging from the Hamas attack last Saturday security cameras showed two women trying to escape a Hamas gunman somehow he misses them armed Israelis arrive and the man who wanted to murder them either Retreats or is killed and at AAL hospital near Tel Aviv signs of the tension in Israel a visiting government Minister gets a furious reception a nurse yells they've been helped by every kind of Civilian but the government has given them nothing the military buildup might steady Israeli nerves and the defense minister said tonight we will wipe Hamas off the face of the Earth Jeremy in BBC News in southern Israel well Palestinian media say the only Power Plant still operating in the Gaza Strip has now stopped working after running out of fuel and as we've been hearing there are more than 200 targets that have been hit by the Israelis in air strikes overnight and these images show the level of Destruction this is the remal area before the strikes and this a light image of the same neighborhood which came through yesterday and has been located by our colleagues at BBC verify more than a thousand people are now known to have died and a quarter of a million have been forced from their homes well Gaza is of course Under Siege and Communications are extremely difficult but we can talk now to our correspondent rushi Abu alouf who's live in Gaza City for us tonight rushi just tell us what the last few days have been like living in an area under siege and under constant bombardment from the air yeah I can see I have been witnessing the heaviest air strike in my 20 years covering of this story it was by far the heaviest I've been witnessing what the destruction in this remel neighborhood it's the for a very long time this neighborhood is been the safe heaven for most of the G and most of the streets in this neighborhood was was destroyed I was among the families who were like suffering on during that days but the humanitarian side of the story is is is moving in a very significant way when we have when when like two million people lost the electricity today we are talking about the essential services such as Medical Services Water Supplies Food Supplies are being suspended because of that the humanitarian Corridor for letting food and medicine and fuel into to Gaza is a must is a call from every Palestinians that why we understand tonight from a senior Egyptian official that Egypt is working closely with other countries and contacting Hamas and Israel to try to find a a draft of six hour to allow goods and fuel to come from Egypt into Gaza and rushi what about the suggestion the possibility of a ground Invasion we heard from Jeremy boen that the more troops are massing on the border with Gaza uh acrossing Israel how are people feeling about the possibility that there could be a ground Invasion this is the most worry for the people people in Gaza are fear this because they have lived through a ground Invasion before back in 2014 we have seen Israeli tanks in refugee camp we are talking about a camp in the North like when 100,000 people live in a very small tiny piece of land if people are already ex exhausted by 3,000 air strikes and 1100 people died o only from from what soldiers and tanks are engaging in Street to to Street and house to house fighting with Hamas in Gaza with two million people living in this tiny piece of land okay we'll end it there rushi Abdul Al thank you very much indeed for joining us live from Gaza where Communications are obviously incredibly difficult to establish and to maintain"}, "mtbw5x9-3Qs": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtbw5x9-3Qs", "video_id": "mtbw5x9-3Qs", "description": "'The large scale of the emergency will mean that for months and years to

International Aid Minister Ahmed hen's office sent the CBC this statement we are extremely concerned about the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation and the impact on civilians we will continue to support civilians with life-saving humanitarian aid while ensuring that no money goes into the hands of Hamas so what are the biggest challenges facing Aid organizations during this humanitarian crisis Tomaso Dela longa is a senior spokesperson for the International Federation of Red Cross and red crescent societies uh thank you for joining us today sir thanks for having me I I wonder I I know the situation in Gaza is fluid I I wonder if you can give us your sense of the humanitarian situation in that area right now well the humanitarian situation I would say that is very very complex as IFC we are looking at this situation with a great uh concern you have to think about um Gaza Strip a very dense and populated area probably the more dense populated area in the world that already was enduring crisis and great human needs before the last escalation and of course in the last hours these humanitary needs are only growing with Israel blocking food water electricity going into the area what is that going to do to the situation there sir well this is again it's a great matter of concern um blocking food and water it's a huge problem for hundreds and thousands of people and again this is a situation that is overlapping other great crisis that Gaza Street and the people in Gaza Street were already living and suffering in the last months and years and of course again it is a great matter of concern for all of us and we do hope that all the parties will find a way to avoid the suffering on civilians what is your number one concern um for the for the Gaza Strip at the moment well at this stage is what the Palestine recent colleagues are telling us that there is not really a safe place where to stay what we are seeing is the um I mean there are bombardments there are targets and then we saw unfortunately that also our teams on the ground are suffering these bombardments and of course we call on all the parties to say the civilians and civilians infrastructure and healthcare workers and Healthcare facilities must be protected and must be respected Israel has told people to get out uh because of the the counter offensive or the retaliation that is coming for the attacks uh conducted by Hamas but there are reports that people are not being allowed to leave have your workers tried to get out of Gaza and have they been able to have they been stopped what's their situation well our uh first aers are from Gaza palestin and volunteers as old the cross and Volunteers in the world are in every emergency because they're part of the local communities and they are trained to respond in every type of Crisis and this exactly the case for our women and men of Palestine and then as you said there is no way out for for Gaza from Gaza the moment as it was in the last years I I know Red Cross and red crescent uh are non-political and they stay out of politics but uh in the wake of these attacks uh countries like Germany and Austria have suspended Aid uh to Palestinian uh organizations the European Union is reconsidering its Aid what impact do you think that will have should these Aid sources dry up of course this is really concerning I would say I mean our call to to donors and partners worldwide is that probably now more than ever people in Gaza community in Gaza needs international support and not just for these days but for the months to come because what we are seeing the large scale of the emergency will mean that for the months and years to come people will need recovery efforts and support so our call to donor is just to continue supporting Gaza and even more in the months and weeks and months to come Canada is not cutting off its Aid it says it will disperse Aid through what it calls trusted Partners like the International Red Cross and red crescent uh but they want to make sure this money never ends up in the hands of Hamas or other groups like that I mean how do you ensure the money only goes to civilian Aid and humanitarian causes well we need to make it clear crystal clear to to the public and to the people that are viewing Us in this moment that the cross has high standard of accountability and we and we are guided solely by our principles and first of all is independence and then of course neutrality and impartiality so in Palestine as everywhere in the world the the the money is used through our trusted part as the Palestine recent but then Under the Umbrella of the International Federation of recent that has these kind of standards and continue control on what is going on so in Gaza as in every part of the world we can assure to donors and to the people that are watching us at the moment that the money will just be used for humanitarian purposes W with the The Siege as Israel calls it and with the blockades that have been happening there for for years now how difficult is it can you even get Aid into Gaza right now uh should you have supplies or medicines or resources that your Volunteers in the area would need could you even get it to them at the moment uh it's it's a it's a noo I mean we can see I mean we we see also in the news how is the situation in Gaza and now the Gaza Strip is locked I mean the good news in the past is that we had the possibility to bring a and for instance our volunteers even today they were distributing some of the stocks that were prepositioning Gaza for any possible emergency but these stocks will finish together with fuel for electricity together with food and water so it really it really I mean there is a desperate cold that in the next days will arrive from Gaza where needs will grow and an enormous scale the the cutting off of the essentials um seems to be a precursor to what may be a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip by the Israeli Defense Forces certainly if you listen to the prevailing wisdom of military experts on the region and listen to what prime minister Netanyahu has said should that prede what are your biggest concerns um for the population in the Gaza Strip protection of civilians protection of civilians infrastructure protection of humanitarian workers protection of healthare protection is the first uh is the first concern of course we are not entering in the political debate on decision but then we are deeply concerned about human suffering and what we are seeing in these days it's really worrisome for all of us what's your message for people who' have been watching these events unfold obviously outraged and horrified uh by the murders and the attacks committed by Hamas but also worried in about what may happen to a non Hamas population inside Gaza well we were all shocked when we saw the terrible shocking images on Saturday and Sunday but this doesn't mean that millions of people in Gaza needs to pay the price so the request again to all the parties is to spare civilians and to do their atmost to respect and protect civilians do do you expect that will happen based on the reaction to this based on the the political response we've seen to the attacks and in terms of what Israel appears to be preparing well as a humanitarian I used to be optimistic because otherwise I should have changed my work so our call stay there but then of course also the preparedness part and the support to the palestin Cent teams will be there Tomaso Del longa with the International Red Cross and red and thank you so much for your time today thank you"}, "qUDkZ6V1uKM": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUDkZ6V1uKM", "video_id": "qUDkZ6V1uKM", "description": "The humanitarian

warned that nowhere in Gaza is safe as Israel steps up its preparations for an expected ground Invasion Israeli tanks and Northern Gaza setting the stage for Israel's next phase of combat a full ground war has not started yet but air strikes are hitting the Gaza Strip nonstop theyve already reduced entire neighborhoods to Rubble because of the bombing destruction and killing I came to seek shelter inside this camp with nine members of my family in two cars I had to sleep out in the open in the heat for 10 days to get a tent Israel says it is striking targets of the islamist militant group Hamas considered a terrorist organization by many Western governments according to the UN about 1.4 million gazin are now displaced the organization now says nowhere is safe in the entire Gaza Strip residents there who have no way out of the strip are calling for an end to the hostilities we don't want war we want it to stop we're so tired we're overwhelmed we stand in Long cues just to use the toilets we don't even have basic rights we are more like lifeless bodies a Complete Siege imposed by Israel after the Hamas terror attack has caused a critical shortage of supplies and air strikes are impeding eight deliveries uh we've been asked if we've been able to deliver to the Turkish Hospital which is uh perhaps the biggest provider of cancer services in in Gaza the answer is no um the answer is no because we do not have security guarantees to deliver that Aid International diplomacy efforts for a ceasefire have so far failed a ground war to topple mass now may worsen an already dire situation in Gaza well earlier I talked to DW correspondent tany kma in Jerusalem she tell me more about the Israeli incursion into Gaza overnight while the Israeli military confirmed only that uh what they described as a targeted raid into Gaza they also released uh this video where you can see tanks and the Infantry basically moving in they say they targeted that Hamas infrastructure there also Hamas militants and the Army Radio described it as the largest incursion yet as to date so they also said that this is done in preparation for the next stages of combat possibly referring to a even larger uh ground uh incursion that uh everybody in Israel at least is waiting for all of this happens of course with also massive air bombardment uh Israeli air bombardment on uh the Gaza Strip and north and south and we heard again also uh that Palestinians still in the north of Gaza where also is the Gaza City uh were called on leaving and that prompted also a statement by the UN un's humanitarian coordinator this Hastings saying that Palestinians they face an impossible situation because some had opted to stay they don't have the means or they don't want to leave so it's a very very difficult situation for the civilian population there tell you with heard Israel's primee Minister there explaining that preparations are still underway for a ground operation as they have been for days did he shed uh any new light as to what we can expect of that operation well I think he needed to address the Israeli public there are a lot of questions being asked where this is going in Israel uh people are looking uh what's happening in Gaza obviously but also what is happening in noris on the northern border with Hezbollah as well and uh he didn't say much new he said that the ground offensive will happen soon but he didn't give any details he also said that uh a priority is still also to get the hostages the Israeli hostages and other foreign Nationals that are being held in Gaza now at the number of 224 only four were were released so far that are being held in Gaza to get them out he also briefly touched on saying that um basically talking about the responsibility this is one of the big questions that's being discussed as well in Israel for uh what happened on October 7 when Hamas uh breached the border and went into Southern uh Israel he said everyone will have to ask and answer those questions but this will be done after the war T briefly you you mentioned the growing tensions in the north at the border with Lebanon how is Israel handling the prospect of fighting on two fronts at the same time I mean there is a lot of concern that the second front will be opening and we've seen over the past two and a half weeks tensions Rising there lot of cross border fighting and uh we also uh see that the Israeli government has asked you know most of the villages and towns in the close to the Lebanese border to evacuate and to go further uh to the center of the country so there is concern that a second front will be opening uh you know there could be miscalculation military analysts here are saying there could be a preemptive Strife by Israel or Hezbollah might join uh the war as they put it once this ground Invasion might go ahead T ker in Jerusalem thank you let's bring in Hiba Tibi here she's country director for the humanitarian organization care responsible for the West Bank and Gaza she joins us from rala in the West Bank welcome to the program he start with a situation in Gaza you're in daily contact with your colleagues there what are they telling you I was just before the interview with my colleague on phone and they were explaining to me that the situation is becoming more and more harder only today they had to go for bread cues that are now taking six hours in average to find a loaf of bread or limited amount it's like limited amount per family and they are for instance my colleague had to leave at 4:00 a.m. just to reserve a spot in the queue uh this is not the only issue that they are facing the water uh in the beginning the first days of the war they were able to secure water from the municipality pumped not clean water the salty one for Hygiene purposes and they it used to come for for 3 hours every 3 4 days now it is not coming anymore and I'm pretty sure that you already heard about the drinking water water that is not available in Gaza anymore because it requires fuel that replaces electricity for uh pumping and treating the water to become more drinkable now Israel has told Palestinians in the Gaza Strip to leave the North and move to the South but the UN says that some Palestinians who did that who fled their homes in the north are now going back there because they can't find safe shelter even in the South which is supposed to be a safe zone are your colleagues in a similar situation unfortunately it's it's a reality and a fact it's it's a testimony from my colleagues not one not two the five of them who are in in who who evacuated to the South they left their houses there are no houses to go back to by the way three of them how their houses are completely destroyed two of them they don't know if they can if it's safe to go back to their homes but they are unable to stay in the in the South they are staying in apartment designed for 10 people but they are sharing it with 80 people they cannot sleep they cannot access water and it's under constant shelling and by the way those who stayed in the north most of them who did not evacuate did not evacuate because of the the fact that they cannot afford going to the South the the lit of fuel became extremely expensive so for a family an average family to transport from the north I'm talking 10 days ago because every day by the hour the price of fuel gets higher every so in the beginning it would cost the family around 1,000 shakel which is around 350350 and they cannot afford it right now you've issued a statement saying that what's happening in Gaza now is beyond what your team had envisioned as a a worst case scenario but things could get even worse couldn't they yes unfortunately if the UN as they announced are going to stop providing Services if the hospitals are going to stop their services honestly I I don't know what will be the situation already we see doctors we have some contacts with partners with doctors who are providing Medical Services they are doing surgeries using vinegar instead of the minimum anesthesia uh requirements they are treating people on the floor outside the hospitals they are very tired but still they are trying to find a way Medical Supply electricity access to water the the contagious diseases now are breaking in a very scary way in the overcrowded shelters in the UN and even beyond all of the information that we get unfortunately comes only from the shelters that are run by the we don't even count what is happening in the surrounded surrounding areas with the crowded Apartments similar to what my colleagues are facing so this is going to be an unimaginable imagin I can't even find words to describe what will happen if the situation continues to be like this with no humanitarian Supply fuel or water restructured in Gaza and most importantly if the ground Invasion occur in amid of all of what we are seeing already now what is your team doing to prepare for that scenario about a possible ground Invasion because everything is pointing towards that uh ground operation as as the uh Israeli government is calling it what are you doing to prepare for that I will be very Frank with you care has been providing the humanitarian services for war victims since 1945 since the second world war however now in 2023 we are unable to fulfill our mandate over the last days we were able to focus our our intervention from within a you know that and also from Egypt what all our supplies are on the border now what we try to do is to secure what we have from on the ground the worst case scenario that we built our intervention around is nothing compared to what we are seeing now no one I'm confirming no one is prepared to intervene if a a land Invasion occurs what we are seeing now is already massive we are learning from what we have implemented as care International in Mass Destruction like what happened in the earthquake in Turkey but all what we are trying to find is not even working or suitable if no if a ceasefire is not attended now if safe environment is provided for the humanitarian organizations to fulfill their mandate saving lives now we are talking about survival moment it's not Rehabilitation or restructuring only to help in people's in people survival mode hea thank you very much for taking time to talk with us today that was hea TB with the humanitarian organization care speaking to us from rala in the West Bank well let's get the latest from Gaza journalist hzm baloa is there and joined us now on the line ham we understand that fuel is about to run out in Gaza and without it there'll be no electricity what impact is that likely to have uh fuel is not only for electricity it's for everything for water supplies for desalination stations for drinking water for hospitals for uh um uh uh for grocery shops that that have some some supplies that remain there um um um for for Hygiene for cleaning and for collecting the trash from the streets I can see the piles of of of of trash in the street um because the the Ona and municipalities have no fuel for their tracks to collect these stretches so all aspects of Life affected by by by the shortage of a fuel not only the electricity Israel says that Hamas has hoarded fuel supplies and that that's where gazin should get their fuel from do people in Gaza see it that way well in Gaza they don't care about about what's happening on the military level or in the political level they care about their daily life um the fuel is shortage affecting their daily life there are lines of people are waiting to fill the galloons to carry some some water to their places as there is no pumping of the water to the tanks up in the the rooftops um um they they go for for long distance to to get some drinking water from some place is that they still provide the water um um they are looking at like yes sorry uh I was just hm could you walk us quickly through some of the things that you've witnessed there in Gaza during the last 24 hours well um um most most noticeable thing that I from early morning hours I I could hear the the artillery shows no stop in east of of of uh of Gaza strp particularly in bage refugee camp in the central Gaza uh there were some reports that there was some tanks entered the the area uh and there were uh some reports of of of Hamas Fighters fired some rockets at Israeli Jets particularly according to the statement Israeli helicopter and and you know I see now like I'm I'm close to the street to get some some signal in my phone um I see people go and to line at the bakeries and and some of them they carry empty gallons to to fill it with the water ham thank you very much for that update that was journalist ham baloa in Gaza"}, "r-CigdyHMY8": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-CigdyHMY8", "video_id": "r-CigdyHMY8", "description": "What's happening with

Israel-Gaza war answered | Start Here", "uploader": "Al Jazeera English", "transcript": "let's answer some questions about the Israel Gaza [Applause] War it's been almost 2 weeks since Hamas attacked Israel and Israel responded with a massive assault on Gaza thousands have been killed the UN says Gaza is facing a humanitarian catastrophe there's anger across the region about the impact on Palestinian civilians and talk of this spilling into a much bigger conflict there running Street battles at the moment protesters have been trying to break through the security barrier outside the they're throwing stones the whole region is at the brink of folding into the abyss I've been asked a lot of questions on Instagram and I've picked three to answer on issues that have come up a lot let's start with what will happen to all the civilians in Gaza well the short answer is we don't really know what we do know is that the situation ation right now is dire and it will get worse unless the war stops and humanitarian Aid is allowed in remember Gaza is a tiny densely populated strip of Palestinian land it's run by Hamas but more than 2 million people live there and can't get out Israel's bombing campaign has been the fiercest in recent memory Israel says it's targeting Hamas Fighters but air strikes have also hit residential buildings schools and Clinics on Tuesday a strike on a hospital in the north of Gaza killed hundreds of people Gaza Health officials say it was an Israeli air strike the Israelis blamed a misfired rocket from the armed Palestinian group Islamic jiad last week Israel cut off food fuel water and electricity supplies into to Gaza and supplies of everything are running [Music] out Israel did allow drinking water into Gaza for about three hours on October 16th but it was a fraction of what's needed according to the UN the UN also says people are drinking salty water from agricultural Wells and they're concerned about the spread of disease then there's the mass displacement of people more than half of gaza's population have had to leave their homes there's also been a huge movement of people from the north of Gaza to the South while Israeli air strikes have continued everywhere Israel told civilians living in the north more than a million people they had 24 hours to evacuate ahead of a possible ground Invasion something the UN said was impossible without devastating humanitarian consequences and we still don't know for sure how many people did leave and how many stayed not everyone could leave others chose to stay or have now returned because conditions in the South are so bad bombardments did not stop in the southern parts of the Gaza Strip that's in h Raa and and that's why so many families who have evacuated South are going back now because at least at least um if we're going to die we're going to die with digity in our homes Egypt is the only country other than Israel that shares a border with Gaza so there's a big focus on opening up that crossing the Rafa Crossing as an aid route which brings us to our second question why can can't Egypt send supplies or open the Rafa border now there are a lot of issues tied up in that question the backdrop is that Egypt and Israel generally have a pretty Cooperative relationship they signed a peace deal in 1979 and Egypt has often been a mediator in previous conflicts between Israel and Hamas even in so-called normal times Israel maintains a Siege on Gaza controlling who and what goes in and out and that includes coordinating with Egypt about the movement of people and goods through the Rafa Crossing they're complicit with Israel in The Siege U of Gaza which has been going on and this is very hard for Palestinians and other Arabs to accept but it's a it's a reality understanding the current situation at the Rafa Crossing depends on whether we're talking about Aid getting in or people getting out on the aid issue Egypt always said it's been ready to send in supplies but that they couldn't without a safety guarantee from Israel and there's been a lot of Israeli bombing near the Rafa Crossing after US President Joe Biden's trip to Israel Israel now says it will not prevent humanitarian assistance from Egypt as long as it is only food water and medicine for the civilian population in the South and as long as no supplies reach Hamas there are trucks lined up at the border ready to go Egypt's now agreed that 20 can go in but it's not confirmed when now when it comes to people getting out the politics is even Messier most of the diplomacy is focused on Palestinian duel Nationals so Palestinians who are also citizens of other countries the US for example estimates there are around 600 Palestinian Americans trapped in Gaza right now usually dual Nationals would be able to get in and out of Gaza pretty easily using the rafic crossing but not now I a US citizen my country told me to come here we went through hell coming through here we don't know what's going on why we were told to come and when are we going to get out of here it's hopeless my message is to secretary blinkin if we were Israelis would this happen to us then there's everyone else in Gaza given how dangerous Gaza is right now A lot of people are wondering why all Palestinians can't flee to safety across the border to Egypt well that's a scenario that Egypt and other Arab states have ruled out Egypt sees that scenario as a national security risk that would spread gaza's crisis into Egypt itself and it says National Security is a red line it won't cross It also says it won't take in Palestinian refugees as a matter of principle it says it stands by the goal of a two-state solution meaning a Palestinian State alongside the state of Israel and that taking in large numbers of refugees would undermine that Jordan's taking a similar position many Palestinians are worried about this too that is a red line uh because I think that is the plan by certain of The Usual Suspects to try and create de facto issues on the ground no refugees in Jordan no refugees in Egypt if Egypt were to open its border and a million Palestinians would leave Gaza and go to Sinai in theory just for temporary protection the fear is they never go back they don't want to suffer another neba where half the Palestinian population in 1947-48 was driven out of Palestine or fled because there was war and this is something that people are very aware of now on the on the Egyptian front now our last question which is actually two questions where is this going to go how is it going to end while no one can predict the outcome of this here are some things to consider there's the risk that it becomes an even bigger War remember Hamas is part of an alliance that includes the armed group Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iran Israel has already been exchanging fire with Hezbollah across its shared border with Lebanon and Iran's foreign minister has warned that it could take measures against Israel if they don't deescalate while Israel says it's ready for for a bigger fight we are prepared to fight uh if needs be on two fronts uh we have the ability to do so we can do it on more fronts as well another thing to think about is how Israel's ground Invasion might play out we've been expecting it for almost a week now Israel's called up hundreds of thousands of army reservists and troops and tanks have been amassing in southern Israel near the Gaza border but the longer a ground Invasion doesn't happen the more people are questioning whether the Israeli plans could change there's there been a slight shift in the messaging from the Israelis on Tuesday an army spokesperson said everybody's talking about the ground offensive it might be something different and now there's also so much anger in Arab countries about the hospital strike in Gaza some analysts think that could also play into Israel's calculation on a ground Invasion remember there's a lot of diplomacy going on behind the scenes between Israel the US and Arab leaders a ground Invasion would mean urban Warfare and even more casualties humanitarian or organizations are warning that it would be disastrous for Palestinian civilians there's also a huge risk that the captives being held by Hamas and Gaza around 200 according to Israel would end up getting hurt or killed the Israelis are walking into a trap and they know it the Israelis are very good in their Air Force they can destroy we've seen what they have done in Gaza they can level the city but they cannot guarantee a success of the Infantry so how is this going to end well that depends what you think about Israel's stated goal it says it's about wiping out Hamas but many people are questioning what that really means or if it's even possible they could kill many or all of the Hamas leaders but that wouldn't do anything other than spark an even more um determined and and more militant movement that would follow some years down the road Hamas is uh an idea um it's a visceral political National human response to Decades of occupation and subjugation the truth is that the more they attempt to control Gaza and isolate Gaza and contain Gaza the less secure Israel becomes not the more secure the story of Gaza the struggle of the Palestinians does not begin and end with Hamas when you say Victory what do you mean what's going to be of Gaza what can we do to leverage this Unthinkable round of blooded into a positive path forward there should be choreography to address the core issues of this conflict security is one of them but occupation if you don't deal with occupation you're doing nothing and I'm saying that is in Israeli [Music]"}, "PsK1_bGIBTs": {"url":

assembled for a ground incursion Israel has vowed to destroy the Palestinian Hamas militia after its unprecedented Terror attacks on Southern Israel but Hamas has taken hostages into Gaza complicating Israel's Invasion plans on Saturday the Israeli Army said it had recovered the bodies of hostages killed just inside the Gaza Strip perimeter we need to be very delicate around this issue we are concerned about the hostages uh we are continually working in order to identify and the process of identifying bodies that have been mutilated and burned is very tedious and very timely I want to be respectful to them yes of course we did say yesterday that there were Israelis retrieved in the in the ground operations Israel has vowed to uphold its Complete Siege of Gaza until all all hostages are freed Pope Francis has called for humanitarian corridors to help those under sieg in Gaza the Pope's appeal comes as Israel readies its troops for a ground assault and retaliation for unprecedented attacks it suffered a week ago as we have heard now Pope Francis has also renewed his call for the release of the hostages kidnapped by Hamas militants I am again appealing for the release of the hostages and I strongly urge that children the sick the elderly women and all civilians should not fall victim to the conflict humanitarian law must be respected especially in Gaza where it is urgent and necessary to guarantee humanitarian corridors and help the population Ahmed al- mandari is the World Health organization's Regional director for the Eastern Mediterranean and I asked him how far it has been possible in these days to evacuate patient answering your question I'd like just to share with you numbers uh there are around 22 hospitals in that area in which Israel ask you know them to be evacuated uh hosting around 2,000 patients many of them are on ventilators um many of them are on regular uh 24 hours you know medications like cancer therapy renal dialysis unfortunately what you know this represents around 61% of the bed capacities in the whole of Gaza the other hospitals on the other side you know in which they were pushed to move are already full 99.9% full capacity there are no IU beds there are no beds in the ordinary WS operation theaters are fully working 24 hours with a severe shortage of supplies uh there's shortage of water and electricity in the coming few hours you know if no solution is coming out in addition to that clear you know I'd like just to share that there are around 120,000 people in Gaza Strip you know suffering from different types of chronic illnesses like you know 52,000 of them 52,000 patients with diabetes there are around 25 pregnant women uh in which 180 deliveries a day so it means that we are really putting death sentence to those group of people who are in need of that service in in every second of the hour so it's not just in hospitals but also health concerns for people across the Gaza Strip I want to look at aid from The Who yesterday your organization has told us that it sent a plain load of supplies that is now sitting in Egypt waiting to get into Gaza do you think that we are close to an agreement that will allow those supplies to finally cross into Gaza this is what we are hoping you know to to to get in the coming few hours based on whatever negotiations our director generalus is making and also my counterpart Hans clogan from the regional director you know of Europe in addition to the other political leaders around the globe asking the Israelis you know to make sure that you know ra for example border nearby Egypt is open our supply is there in Alish airport which is around 20 kilometer away from rafah it is there available to be shipped to Gaza our teams are also available in the regional office here and headquarter uh there are further supplies available in our logistic Hub in Dubay uh we we manag to re you know secure around 3 million plus 1 million US dollars to buy these supplies so we are available in in each you know the moment they tell us the you know RAF Cross Point is open we are ready to go inside and provide the support so your team is ready to move in as soon as it is allowed and possible can you tell us a little bit more about exactly what is in those supplies that will be sent to Gaza to help people there these supplies included in fact you know trauma kits that can be used to treat those injured people either on streets in the field or in hospitals uh there are kids you know containing um surgical kits to do operation inside the hospitals there are medications for um chronic illnesses like diabetes hypertension uh there are kids also to provide for around 300,000 people including pregnant ladies to provide them with the care they need inside hospitals and also in the field well thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us on DW news we really appreciate your time today that is W the who's Ahmed Al and haret

"title": "UN chief says 'clear violations of humanitarian law' in Gaza - BBC News", "uploader": "BBC News", "transcript": "next we're going to take a look at the diplomacy that's ongoing well right now actually in the past week we have seen a number of world leaders head to Israel uh to offer support and try to deescalate the crisis today it was Emanuel macron of France France here he is as you can see next to Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu he expressed solidarity with Israel says the first objective of the war should be to free all hostages and he says it was Israel's duty to fight against Hamas but he warned against enlarging the conflict let's take a listen I consider that this is an International Coalition in order to fight against these terrorist groups that we have to build I REM I just reminded my people in my language what we discussed about fight against terrorism humanitarian action rules to be respected but as well political process and obviously I warned against an escalation and I want esbah and some other regimes not to be part of what's happening I know how committed you are let me Express once again my solidarity my friendship and the fact that France stands with you so International diplomacy in Israel also in New York too a meeting of the UN Security Council is under away un Secretary General Antonio gues condemned the Hamas attacks and said he was deeply concerned about what he described as a clear violations of international humanitarian law in Gaza he said even War has rules and that the Hamas attack on October 7th did not take place in a vacuum nothing can justify the deliberate killing injuring and kidnapping of civilians or the launching of rockets against civilian targets all hostages must be treated humanely and released immediately and without conditions it is important to also recognize the attacks by amas did not happen in a vacuum the Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation well the Israeli foreign minister was not impressed with the secretary uh General's comments take a listen these kids witness orror which cannot be described by word Mr Secretary General in what world do you live definitely this is not our world this is a terrorist of Hamas what he said in there in Arabs he telling to his mother and fathers that he's proud that he has blood of 10 Jewish that he murdered what monster they gave a birth to Secretary General this is the world that we live foreign minister Eli Cohen there and in the last hour we have heard that he has also cancelled a planned meeting with Secretary General gues that was scheduled for this evening we also heard uh from the top Palestinian Authority Diplomat the ongoing massacres being deliberately and systematically and savagely perpetrated by Israel the occupying power against the Palestinian civilian population under its illegal occupation Must Be Stopped the security Council has a duty to stop them the International Community is obliged under international law to stop them it is our Collective human duty to to stop them now continued failure at this council is inexcusable and let's take you live to New York to show you that uh the meeting is still ongoing we are keeping our eyes and ears across it whilst we do that let's speak to Lieutenant General Mark schz former US security coordinator for Israel and the Palestinian Authority uh who is now with the Rand Corporation an American nonprofit or organization thank you very much for coming on the program thank you Lois it's good to be with you can I just get your reaction first of all just to the uh diplomacy and the words we've heard from around that table this afternoon well I I think there are two realities um certainly the reality that uh you know from October 7th and what the uh families of the victims of that horrific terrorist attack and the subsequent kidnapping of 200 Israelis that are still being held by Hamas but there's also the reality of the Palestinian people and um I think it's accurate and important to highlight uh what is happening inside of Gaza uh specifically with you know the impact of the ongoing uh air and addiction campaign for Preparation uh for the ground offensive and as important but not spoken a lot about are the ongoing confrontations that are occurring between the Israeli security forces and the West Bank settlers provocations by settlers in the West Bank and the violence that's ensued over the course of uh you know certainly well before October 7th but in Earnest now since uh the October 7th terrorist attack and and I want to bring in the role of the US here what in your eyes is the role what what is it in practice in relation to its uh strong Allied relationship with Israel and what do you think it to be trying to do well certainly as we know they're our strongest Ally in the region and we're giving unequivocal support to uh the Israeli government certainly to the military to include the recent deployment of not only the two carrier strike groups but also senior military advisers to share our lessons uh that we experienced in Iraq uh both in the initi found as in Fusia and then subsequent to the liberation of mosul from from Isis so very important but also what we're doing to emphasize the importance of alleviating the humanitarian suffering that's ongoing um in Gaza as well as West Bank you know not welln but the US has historically been the largest single donor to support the Palestinian people from both humanitarian assistance as well as um security assistance in the West Bank so I think it's important that we continue to emphasize the rules of law as it comes to uh Warfare but also to do all we can in you know speaking with Israel certainly but also the broader International Community to alleviate the humanitarian suffering that's occurring in Gaza specifically and there have been reports in Us Media that the Biden Administration has been urging Israel to delay any ground incursion into Gaza more time for hostage negotiations is the presumption do you think that is happening or ought to be happening I I I there's certainly dialogue occurring um while there's ongoing discussions and negotiations and we've seen you've just reported the release now of four um hostages two American and two Israeli and ideally there will there will be many more um in the coming days so I I do think while dialogue ongoing it's important that um the ground offensive is not does not commence because once that occurs I believe any type of dialogue with Hamas with respect to releasing of the hostages will cease um I think also what's occurring behind the scenes is the discussion of the Strategic objective uh Beyond just eliminating the Hamas military capability and it's and the political cap you know political structure of H also what what is Gaza going to like in the Palestinians subsequent to this land uh okay will take place liutenant General

DOCTOR, I KNOW YOU ARE IN CHICAGO RIGHT NOW, BUT YOU'VE GOT YOUR TEAM ON THE GROUNDS IN GAZA. WHAT HAS THE LAST WEEK BEEN LIKE. WHAT ARE THEY TELLING YOU? HOW SCARED ARE YOU FOR THEIR SAFETY? >> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME, STEPHANIE. THIS SITUATION IT IS BEYOND CATASTROPHIC. IT IS NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW IN THE HOSPITAL IN GAZA. I'VE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE LEAD DOCTOR -- THIS MORNING THROUGH WHATSAPP. HE TOLD ME THAT THEY ARE UNABLE TO EVACUATE THE -- HOSPITAL. THEY RECEIVED THE ORDER TO EVACUATE THE PEDIATRIC HOSPITAL, ABOUT 170 PATIENTS. YOU HAVE THE CHILDREN AND INTENSIVE CARE UNIT, YOU HAVE NEWBORN IN INCUBATORS. THEY DON'T HAVE THE RECEIVING END -- THERE IS NOT ENOUGH BEDS TO ACCOMMODATE THEM. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TRANSPORT THEM IN THIS SITUATION WITH THE WAR, WITH THE BOMBING, WITH THE LACK OF RESOURCES, THE LACK OF DIESEL FUEL. EVEN IF HOSPITALS WANT TO EVACUATE THE SOUTHERN ISRAEL, AND THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO LOGISTICALLY. AND THERE ARE THREE PATIENT -- 3000 PATIENTS RIGHT NOW IN NORTHERN -- AND THERE ARE ONLY 3000 BEDS IN SOUTHERN GAZA. IT'S COMPLETELY. FOR THE FIRST TOOL WHEN YOU EVACUATE PATIENTS, OF COURSE, IS TO HAVE A RECEIVING. AND THERE IS NO RECEIVING IT. ALSO, THE SHEER NUMBER OF INJURIES THAT ARE RECEIVING THE HOSPITALS, THE TYPE OF INJURIES I'VE SEEN HORRIFIC PICTURES AND IMAGES OF CHILDREN BLEEDING, ON THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND THE FLOOR OF THEM ARE CONSUMED BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH BEDS TO ACCOMMODATE THEM ON EVERY EXAM TABLE THERE IS PEOPLE SCREAMING, SOME OF THEM ARE IN COMPLETE SHOCK. THERE IS COMPLETE CHAOS, WHICH REMINDED ME OF WHAT HAPPENED IN -- AT THE TIME OF THE -- 2017. IT WAS HAPPENING IN UKRAINE. I JUST CAME BACK FROM UKRAINE AND I WITNESSED THE IMPACT OF THE RUSSIAN BOMBING ON UKRAINIAN VILLAGES AND HOSPITALS. AND ON TOP OF, THAT YOU HAVE A BLOCKADE OF DIESEL FUEL, OF MEDICINE, MEDICAL SUPPLIES, OF FOOD. THERE IS SCARCITY OF RESOURCES. PHYSICIANS ARE TRYING TO RATION THE USE OF GAS, OF CHEST TUBES, OF SUTURE GETS, EVERYTHING, BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT SURE IF THEY WILL HAVE THAT TOMORROW. AND MY ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN TRYING TO DISPUTE -- DISTRIBUTE MEDICAL SUPPLIES THAT WE PROCURED IN THE FIRST FEW DAYS OF THE HOSPITALS. THE AMOUNT OF MENTAL HEALTH TRAUMA IS UNIMAGINABLE. WE HAD THE COVID PANDEMIC IN CHICAGO AND THE REST OF THE U.S.. THE IMPACT ON OUR MEDICAL STAFF, IN CHICAGO, WAS TERRIBLE. HALF OF THE NURSES IN MY HOSPITAL QUIT BECAUSE THEY WERE IMPACTED BY THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS WHO WERE VERY SICK. MANY OF THEM WERE DYING ON US, ESPECIALLY IN THE FIRST FEW DAYS OF THE PANDEMIC, A FEW MONTHS OF THE PANDEMIC. THIS IS HAPPENING IN GAZA EVERY MINUTE, EVERY MINUTE THERE IS A LARGE NUMBER OF CHILDREN WHO ARE INJURED, WHO ARE PULLED FROM UNDER THE RUBBLE. THERE IS VERY LIMITED THINGS TO DO WITH THEM. ON TOP OF, THAT THEN YOU HAVE THE UNCERTAINTY OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN TOMORROW. SOME OF THE PHYSICIANS, THE NURSES LOST THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS BECAUSE OF THE BOMBING -- IN THE HOSPITAL, HE GOT TO KNOW HIS FATHER AND BROTHER WERE KILLED IN THE BOMBING. AND THE FACT THAT THEY ARE NOT SURE WHETHER THEY ARE THEMSELVES WILL BE ALIVE TOMORROW, OR THE DAY AFTER. >> WHAT ARE THOSE >> SO DOCTORS INSIDE WHAT ARE THOSE THOSE HOSPITALS TELLING YOU? DOCTORS INSIDE THE HOSPITALS TELLING YOU? IF THIS GROUND INVASION FROM ISRAEL IS POTENTIALLY IMMINENT, AND THEY CANNOT EVACUATE, IF THERE ARE CHILDREN AND INCUBATORS AND VENTILATORS AND THEY ARE TRAPPED THERE, WHAT DO THEY BELIEVE THEIR FATE WILL BE? >> UNFORTUNATELY, MANY OF THE CHILDREN, EVEN WITHOUT THE INVASION AND WITHOUT ELECTRICITY AND THE VENTILATORS WILL STOP WORKING, INCUBATORS WILL STOP WORKING. OPERATING ROOMS AND ELEVATORS IN THE HOSPITALS AND EVERYTHING, WE HAVE A SIMILAR SITUATIONS AFTER HURRICANE KATRINA WHERE HOSPITALS HAD TO EVACUATE, SOME OF THEM TOOK FOUR DAYS. WITH ALL OF THAT TECHNOLOGIES AND THE TRANSPORT SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE HERE, IN THE UNITED STATES IMAGINE THE SITUATION IN GAZA. UNFORTUNATELY MANY PATIENTS WILL DIE, YOUNG CHILDREN WHO ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE TO WHAT HAPPENED IN ISRAEL. AND THAT'S A HUGE TRAGEDY. NO ONE KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THEM, EVEN IF THEY DECIDE TO TRANSPORT THEM MANY OF THEM WILL DIE DURING THE TRANSPORTATION ITSELF. >> I AM OUT OF TIME BUT I HAVE TO ASK, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE WATER SITUATION? >> AS FAR AS I KNOW, WATER IS VERY LIMITED IN THE BUILDINGS ON THE HOSPITALS THAT WE ARE SUPPORTING AND THERE IS STILL WATER. I HEARD THE NEWS OF THE WATER WAS TURNED ON TODAY BY ISRAEL AND I HOPE THIS IS THE SITUATION. BUT THE SITUATION IS VERY FLUID. WATER IS IMPORTANT FOR MANY THINGS.

"transcript": "meanwhile the Israel Hamas war was front and center at the UN Security Council Tuesday Canada's ambassador to the United Nations Bob Ray spoke last hour we welcome the agreements that have been reached between Israel and Egypt to enable the start of Crossings into Gaza but in order to to prevent a deeper catastrophe for Palestinian civilians in Gaza we must all do more Canada supports humanitarian pauses in order to protect civilians to get more human Arian assistance in and to get foreign Nationals out of Gaza the United States is also calling for humanitarian pauses so what does this reveal about global opinion of this conflict two former Canadian ambassadors to the region join me now Dennis hak previously served as Canada's ambassador to Saudi Arabia and as head of Canada's mission to Iran John Allen previously served as Canadian ambassador to Israel gentlemen it's great to have you both back thanks so much for joining me Dennis I wonder if we could start with you let's start on the calls today from the US and Canada for humanitarian pauses to allow Aid into Gaza very different than the calls from ceasefire coming from countries like Egypt Saudi Arabia and turkey what does this say about where things are I think everyone's realize that there is a humanitarian uh challenge in in in Gaza a catastrophe really and the need to get Aid in and perhaps get hostages out and other other Nationals out but there's a concern I think a lot of Western countries certainly Israel has that that a ceasefire which presumably would last a considerable amount of time would allow Hamas to to regroup uh and and and and and solidify their positions uh get their feet under their ground under their get their feet under them and that's a risk so it's trying to find a balance between that and the need to get humanitarian assistance in so so John the obviously the they don't want to ceasefire uh for the reasons Dennis has outlined there at least that's what the Canadian government and others are saying does the call for humanitarian PA us tell us anything about how they feel about Israel's actions inside Gaza or is it just a response to the humanitarian world how how do you view it no I think the response of all countries is sincere they're seeing the same pictures that your audience just saw they know that people in in the South and in the north are suffering and suffering terribly and the minimum that uh the world has to do is get in food and medicine and water and hopefully fuel um as is needed by the hospitals Etc but I agree with with Dennis um a ceasefire is not on because um that in essence takes away what the West has argued which is Israel's right to self-defense and to try and go in and uh and deal with the political and military leaders of Hamas John the key thing you mentioned there at the end was Fuel and we got some mixed messaging out of Israel today the head of the IDF said they might be willing to let that in if it only went to civilians but also one of the top advisers to to Benjamin Netanyahu said there's no way they're going to let that happen because of potential diversion to Hamas uh We've also heard from the health officials how badly they need fuel in the hospitals do do you think Israel will relent on that and and clear it up and allow it to go in and could it even be policed I hope it will but um we've also heard um that um Hamas went to anr's uh fuel reserves and uh took them for their own purposes and so you can see why Israel has some concerns but we've got to balance the humanitarian against the security concerns and I think in in this case um the hospitals needed the desalinization plants need it uh the trucks to to further deliver the food I think uh there's some question that they might need it as well so um I'm hoping that that that will happen uh as well Dennis uh there was an unusual development today uh French president Emanuel macron was was in Israel uh the latest of the G7 leaders to go there and he said his country was ready for an International Coalition against Isis that ready for the International Coalition against Isis to also fight Hamas he was little light on details but how would that work what's your sense of what macron is proposing there I have no idea to be perfectly honest I can't imagine any any Coalition members other international players going in and trying to deal with Hamas this is an Israeli problem and I can't imagine that that Canada France us anybody else who's involved the Isis Coalition is is going to want to deal with Hamas I just don't understand really what he's getting at John John do you see it the same way absolutely um uh France has a long history of making proposals complex proposals often H with very little follow through and I agree with Dennis uh there's no way that anybody is going into Gaza other than than Israel uh and um you know the leaders are inside Gaza and uh that will be Israel's job alone okay um so maybe no Coalition there uh but but there is the potential for this widening because the Pentagon said today that US forces have come under attack more than a dozen times in Iraq and Syria in the past week and some of these attacks were made by Iranian proxy groups now the US insists they haven't seen a direct order from tan to carry out these attacks but they warned Iran today that the US will defend itself so Dennis what is the calculations here from Iran with words like that being spoken in Washington um Iran has been cultivating proxies and partners all across the region Hezbollah Hamas uh number of groups in Syria and Iraq for to try and keep Israel at Bay to try and remind uh Israel that there are forward defense positions forward per forward defense units that uh that Israel that that Iran can use against Israel to keep them on their toes and and it's a it's forward defense position in some ways some of these groups that's why they've spent all this money and all this time and I I'm I don't know that I don't think that Iran gives necessarily operational demands on Hezbollah or Hamas or others here's you have to do x y and Zed right now but the idea of sort of keeping us forces at Bay to remind them that look you can suffer some damage as well uh Iran trying to to demonstrate and Iran supporting groups to demonstrate you know that they have capabilities as well it's it's it's it's part of Iran's long-term efforts to try and spread its influence and and demonstrate that it's a player that needs to be dealt with John what's your assessment of how Iran is playing this in the past couple of weeks well uh you know a lot of people have said that um Hezbollah is there uh as a deterrent to keep uh Israel on its toes and not to even think about attacking Iran and people have all also said and I agree that it's it's not unlikely but it's not clear that Iran wants to waste Hezbollah on the Palestinians because if Hezbollah engages in a big way we will see a repeat of 2006 there will be bombing in South Beirut there will be bombing in other parts of Lebanon and the Lebanese people who have suffered dearly in the last few years will only suffer more and I think Hezbollah politically with and domestically has got to be very careful about avoiding that Dennis if Hezbollah does get aggressive on on Israel's northern border in a big way and ignores you know J's assessment of Hezbollah being wasted on Hamas could we see strikes into Iran would the Israelis uh do that I mean is it the potential of it widening even Beyond just the northern border and bringing Iran into this conflict I don't think so at this point I mean it depends how things been out of control obviously and it's very difficult to try to predict what tyan will do but I think having Hezbollah uh try and create more difficulties uh for Israel on their northern border is is is their objective is to make it much more complicated for Israel to just focus completely on Gaza I don't think Israel would want to start another front if you will with Iran and nor do I think Iran would want that either it would be very complicated very difficult for for Israel to fight on all those fronts so I I don't see it happening plus you could then get perhaps uh Iran causing problems in the Gulf as they have in the past as well so I think Iran is conscious about not wanting to to escalate but on the other hand trying to make things as difficult as possible for uh for Israel uh and and I think Hezbollah has very much the same view John just to sort of bring it back to where we started this conversation on the on the call for humanitarian pauses because of what we're seeing uh out out of Gaza and the images we just saw and Margaret Evans pieces were was were jarring um the ground Invasion hasn't happened yet uh and assuming that it will still go ahead we're likely to see a lot more like that what kind of a position does does Israel find itself in on the cusp of a potential ground Invasion and and what could be weeks if not months of urban Warfare in terms of international opinion well Israel is really between IR rock and a hard place uh they have had had the worst massacre in their history since the Holocaust we all know that they have a population even peacemakers whom I'm in regular contact with feel that Israel has to strike back that they have to try and deal with Hamas and yet they know and Hamas knows and the world knows that going into that heavily populated urban area is inevit going to cost human lives Hamas knows it they're going to continue to place themselves under hospitals and under schools and they're got the hostages so they're going to do everything possible to make Israel look bad and Israel will look bad and and the world will criticize it but um as any country who just faced what Israel faced irrespective of the history of the root causes of occupation is Isel feels it has to strike and and I I'm pretty convinced it will uh gentlemen there's a lot more we could talk about but unfortunately we're out of time so we got to say goodbye uh but I promise we'll have you both back we always appreciate your time John Allen

humanitarian pauses a 3our notice period will be issued ahead of these pauses the United States calls it a humanitarian pause the Israeli Army calls them tactical localized pauses two corridors out of the north to allow civilians in Gaza to move South it's the first uh um very limited very partial agreement that the two sides have come to but it is the first White House says Israel will pause its military operations for 4 hours daily in Northern Gaza the fact that this announcement came from the White House is important and we'll get to that in a minute but first let's understand what's in this agreement in theory the pause would allow for three immediate things it would help aid groups get food and supplies into Gaza it would allow for foreign Nationals in Northern Gaza to travel to the Rafa border crossing and it would mean that Palestinians who are still in the north where the heaviest fighting has been would be able to evacuate South each day you're going to have these corridors the idea is to get uh the Palestinian civilians out of the war zone so that Israel can attack the um the headquarters and command centers of Hamas according to the White House there will be two humanitarian corridors allowing people to escape the violence in the northern part of Gaza one of them has been partially open for several days now according to Israel yesterday 50,000 people walked down during that time today um tens of thousands also left the second route along the coastal Road will enable many more thousands to reach safer areas in the South another part of the agreement is that civilians will get 3 hours notice when and where these pauses will happen the Israeli Defense Forces posted that onx yesterday saying that the pauses will be limited in time and area in specific locations for a given period of a few hours here a few hours there we want to facilitate a safe passage of civilians away from the zone of fighting and we're doing that since the conflict began Israel has repeatedly told civilians to evacuate South a lot of the fighting and targeted air strikes have been happening in Northern Gaza which the Israeli Army says is a Hamas stronghold with several targets Israel's military says Hamas has lost control of Northern Gaza as thousands of Palestinians are moving south to flee that fighting but civilians in Gaza have repeatedly said there isn't anywhere for them to go and for many nowhere in Gaza feels safe for this young girl gaza's South was supposed to be safer Israel's military again encouraging people to flee here but still hitting what it says are Hamas Targets in the area in the rubble children's possessions lives devastated the Hamas run Health Ministry in Gaza says more than 11,000 Palestinians have been killed since the War Began while calls for humanitarian pause have been happening for weeks experts say that even with this agreement there are cautions lots of things could go wrong here you could stop firing in and then one lone fighter on either side fires and that breaks the pause right away people fir back because the Israeli Defense Forces and the Hamas Fighters don't withdraw from their position and they're exposed right because it's just a path so they are very easily broken by a lone incident which starts things going again which is why the United States has been pushing for something even more substantial President Biden had asked the Israeli Prime Minister for a three-day pause uh in order to facilitate hostage release but also to get uh you know significant amounts of Aid in this is definitely something that the Americans have been pushing uh relentlessly through the president through their special Envoy on the ground through the Secretary of State us officials haven't confirmed how many Americans are being held hostage by Hamas but we know there are still Americans unaccounted for how do you remove the the hostages from the tunnel they have to assemble in a safe place uh they have to cross the border or they have to be picked up by a helicopter you need to be sure that there's no firing during an operation like that but for now at least the Americans say it's progress we believe that this is uh an important step in the right direction from a military perspective a pause is a negative from a humanitarian perspective a pause is absolutely urgent war is volatile violent and unpredictable things can shift and for civilians in Gaza this could all fall apart as quickly as it came together"}, "cP_oTVyrdxE": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP_oTVyrdxE",

sexual assault allegedly perpetrated by Hamas during the October the 7th attacks on Israel and one account in particular that of reservist Sharie Mendes she's not a forensic scientist not an expert but a volunteer whose primary job was to identify and prepare female soldiers for burial she describes seeing blooded underwear faces repeatedly shot she says she tried to give these women the respect they didn't receive when they were murdered the Israeli governments say they're preparing to make their evidence public and the United Nations has urged any remaining living victims to come forward but too much time has passed with no International investigation and that's been the same for so many other conflicts in Ukraine in Ethiopia in Sudan tonight we'll discuss why there's been no concerted Global effort to seek Justice For Those raped and assaulted during war but let's begin with shar's memories of those days in October and a warning that she does describe in detail how women's bodies were mutilated our unit was activated immediately on October 7th my shift came in on Sunday morning October 8th I got to the base and it was unimaginable in two ways it was unimaginable in terms of scale the numbers there were body bags everywhere they were lining the corridors they were lining up in refrigerated trucks coming into to this shura army base where our unit is is is focused um every single victim of the of the October 7th Massacre was brought to to this space so it was unimaginable in the sense that this is a large facility and the Halls were lined to the ceiling with body bags they the smell was unimaginable I I can't tell you enough the shock and despair that that struck all of us and what were you seeing you know as you say there were there were body bags the horror of it in terms of the women that were coming through some of the women that that were coming in what were you seeing there they were shot so many times in the head that that in many in many cases it was like there was um a a purposeful obliteration of women's faces we also saw uh women came in not very dressed and they had often very bloody clothing bloody if they had any clothing they had very bloody underwear women were shot our team has seen women shot in the crotch in the uh genitals women were shot in the breast um you were seeing you saw this our team saw this yes yes um women had legs cut off um there was a lot of um it seemed like there was a systematic genital mutilation of women in the women we saw um sometimes we were told to to run run and part of what we did was uh ACC company these women that was part of our purpose and we never wanted to leave them alone but they they they told everyone who was working on the base you have to get out there's a danger and what was it um people were coming in booby trapped and sappers had to come in and clear clear the situation so that we could go back in I mean the things you're describing totally horrific you've said you're not a forensic expert but you were witnessing some of these Horrors against the women that were coming in what were the forensics experts saying were they were they asking you to collect the the the sort of the clothing and some of the body parts I mean what was the kind of exchange of information that you would you would had with the forensics team so the purpose of our our unit was actually more a Jewish religious role we were there to we were in the examination room because our we were there to accompany these women we often opened body bags we washed jewelry of blood to give back to families of of the deceased I remember one woman had um her arm and her leg were was broken in so many places that it was like handling marbles or sand and at a certain point we said we'll just put a white sheet on top of her in the examination room we did not do any there were experts in that room we were there to accompany the people but then we moved to a room a separate room that was more for us it was a a burial preparation for burial room and in there it was just our team women dealing with women and it was a different atmosphere it was less rushed we are not forensics experts but we felt very strongly that we wanted to give these poor women some respect that they didn't get when they were horribly murdered and mutilated and disfigured and it was our job to to honor them to they could have been our daughters they were the same ages as our children and we we really we figured we might be we probably would be the last people to ever see them so just for a moment we love them um there's lot of conversation around rape sexual violence being used as a weapon of war and as you say you're not an expert you were dealing with the bodies but I guess this is also now part of the the conversation around this as Israel collects the information and the data and the evidence um for this there's also people questioning um you know the the kind of evidence I mean what would your response be to that I would have to say that this is still very early Israel is still um Rockets are still flying at us we are still in very early stages of an investigation we're still in shock we're still in a deep state of trauma 1,200 people were murdered we still have 136 hostages people can come to their own conclusions about whether or not physically from the testimony I'm giving you what happened to them there's an awful lot of eyewitness testimony that that saw rape there was a time in not too recent history when I witness testimony and there's an awful lot of it was enough I'm the child of Holocaust Survivors and all we ever had to know what happened to most of our family my mother survived with her parents almost all of our extended family was murdered we knew what happened to every one of them from eyewitness testimony that may be the best we'll do I mean that's the thing when you see conflict women are the first to be impacted they're the first to disappear in times of War they're the first to to sort of be impacted women and children by conflict and yet their their testimonies and their experience isn't necessarily acknowledged in a lot of places around the world we've seen that happen time and time again especially when it's come to rape being used as a weapon of War if people are not believing them it's hard enough to come forward if the world believes you and Embraces you and rape victims need to be believed if these women are being questioned about the veracity of their claims why should they come forward and I think we have to be patient they're very traumatized and it may take time we're very 117 days into this war it may take a lot of time for these women to to speak out if they ever do Sher thank you so much for your time thank you

THE U.S. HAS LAUNCHED A SERIES  OF STRIKES IN RETALIATION FOR  THE STRIKE AGAINST A BASE AND  JORDAN THAT KILLED THREE U.S.  SOLDIERS LAST WEEKEND.  PLANS FOR AIRSTRIKES IN SYRIA  AND IRAN WERE APPROVED EARLIER  THIS WEEK.  WHITE HOUSE HAS SET A HOLD IRAN  RESPONSIBLE FOR SUPPLYING  WEAPONS TO MILITANT GROUPS WHO  CARRIED OUT ATTACKS ON U.S.  FORCES.  PRESIDENT BIDEN SAID FRIDAY  \"THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT SEE  FOR CONFLICT IN THE MIDDLE EAST  OR ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD,  BUT LET AWLS ALL THOSE WHO  WOULD DO US HARM, ACCOMPANIED  FAMILIES TO THE CEREMONY KNOWN  AS A DIGNIFIED TRANSFER AFTER  MEETING WITH HIM PRIVATELY.  I'M JOINED NOW BY CBS NEWS  CHIEF WHITE HOUSE  CORRESPONDENT,  NANCY CORDES,   AND DAVID MARTIN, AS WELL AS SAM VEE.  SECRETARY WITH DEPARTMENT OF  HOMELAND SECURITY.  WHAT DO WE KNOW MORE ON THE  STRIKES THAT WERE CARRIED OUT  TODAY?  >> THERE WERE 85 TARGETS AND  MORE THAN 125 INDIVIDUAL  MUNITIONS DROPPED ON THOSE  TARGETS.  A PAIR OF B-1 BOMBERS, WHICH  FLEW ALL THE WAY FROM THE  UNITED STATES, WERE INVOLVED,  SO THIS WAS MUCH MORE THAN THE  PREVIOUS RETALIATORY STRIKES WE  HAVE SEEN IN RESPONSE TO THE  ATTACKS ON AMERICAN TROOP  LOCATIONS TO DATE.  I THINK THERE HAVE BEEN  SOMETHING LIKE 165 ATTACKS.  BUT, IT WAS THAT ONE ON SUNDAY  WHICH CROSSED PRESIDENT BIDEN'S  REDLINE, BECAUSE THREE  AMERICANS WERE KILLED.  AND, THE NEXT DAY, HE APPROVED  THE STRIKE WE SAW UNFOLD  TONIGHT.  NOW, THE TARGETS WERE BOTH THE  MILITIAS THAT CARRIED OUT THE  STRIKES AND THEIRANIAN  OPERATIVES THAT WORK WITH  MILITIAS TO ARM, TRAIN, AND  FUND THEM.  PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS SAID  REPEATEDLY THAT HE HOLDS IRAN  ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE.  WE DON'T KNOW YET WHAT THE  DAMAGE WAS THAT THESE STRIKES  CAUSED. THE WHITE HOUSE SAID A  SHORT TIME AGO THAT IT LOOKS  LIKE THEY HIT EVERYTHING THEY  AIMED AT AND DID CONSIDERABLE  DAMAGE, IF NOT TOTAL  DESTRUCTION TO THESE TARGETS.  BUT, THE WHITE HOUSE SAID AGAIN  TONIGHT, AND THE PENTAGON SAID  AGAIN TONIGHT THIS IS JUST THE  BEGINNING, THE START OF THE  RESPONSE.  WE EXPECT TO SEE ONE MORE DAY  OF AIRSTRIKES AGAINST TARGETS  IN IRAQ, AND SYRIA, AND ANOTHER  ROUND OF STRIKES, JOINT STRIKES  BY U.S. AND GREAT BRITAIN  AGAINST HOUTHI TARGETS, IN   YEMEN.  >> NANCY CORDES IS AT THE WHITE  HOUSE.  WHAT IS THE READOUT FROM   ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS, AND  IF WE ARE LOOKING AT ANOTHER  DAY OF STRIKES.  >> Reporter: THEY ARE CERTAINLY  TELEGRAPHING THAT, SAYING THIS  IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF THE  RESPONSE, AND THEY HAVE BEEN  SIGNALING FOR DAYS THEY CALLED  A MULTITIER RESPONSE, SO WE  MIGHT SEE A LOT OF SHOCK AND  AWE AT THE BEGINNING, BUT THAT  WE SHOULD EXPECT MORE.  WE HEARD FROM WHITE HOUSE  OFFICIALS THAT THEY FELT, AS  DAVID SAID, THAT THESE STRIKES  HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL.  BUT, THAT THEY ARE LOOKING  AHEAD, AND IF U.S.  SERVICEMEMBERS ARE INJURED  AGAIN, THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL  RESPOND AGAIN.  YOU READ THAT QUOTE FROM THE  PRESIDENT SAYING, IF AMERICANS  ARE HARMED, THEN THE U.S. WILL  RESPOND.  THAT IS A STRONG STATEMENT,  BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT U.S.  SERVICE MEMBERS HAVE BEEN  TARGETED AT LEAST 165 TIMES IN  IRAQ AND SYRIA ALONE SINCE THE  ISRAEL-THOMAS CONFLICT BEGAN IN  OCTOBER.  SO, THEY CONTINUE TO COME UNDER  FIRE, AND WE SAW THAT SOMEDAY  DEADLY INCIDENT THAT TRIGGERED  THE CULMINATION OF STRIKES WE  SAW TODAY.  >> SAM IS, NEXT STEPS.  >> WE HAVE TO ASSUME THESE  STRIKES ARE LARGER PART OF AN  OPERATION THAT THE PRESIDENT  HAS SIGNED OFF ON, STRIKES, AND  OTHER ORDERS, DIPLOMATIC  OVERTURES, SANCTIONS. RIGHT NOW  IN THE SITUATION ROOM, I WOULD  ASSUME, THE PRESIDENT IS  WAITING TO BE BRIEFED ON THE  BATTLE ASSESSMENT, AS WELL AS  AN INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENT OF  HOW THE IRANIAN REGIME IS  REACTING TO THESE STRIKES.  AT THE SAME TIME, HIS  DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE PERSONNEL  ARE LIKELY SHARING WITH HIM ANY  THREATS TO U.S. MILITARY  INSTITUTIONS OVERSEAS,  CONSULATES, AND OVERALL, THE  SECURITY OF OUR PERSONNEL IS  LOOKING AT THIS STAGE.  I WOULD THINK HOMELAND SECURITY  PROFESSIONALS FROM DHS, AND FBI, ARE LOOKING AT POTENTIAL  REVERBERATIONS IN THE HOMELAND  AS THE IRANIAN REGIME REACTS TO  THESE ATTACKS THEY COULD SEEK  TO ACTIVATE OPERATIVES AROUND  THE WORLD.  >> IT LOOKS LIKE THE ASSESSMENTS ONCE WE HIT DAYLIGHT HOURS WILL  ARRIVE.  MORE ON THE GROUND IN THE  REGION?  >> THERE HAS BEEN A HARD TIME  GETTING INTELLIGENCE ABOUT THE  IRANIAN REGIME AS A PERTAINS TO  THEIR INTENTIONS.  AS WE DREW DOWN FORCES IN IRAQ,  IN AFGHANISTAN, WE DID LOSE A  LOT OF BATTLEFIELD  INTELLIGENCE, SO OUR  INTELLIGENCE GATHERING POSTURE  IS DIFFERENT TODAY THAN IT WAS  AT THE HEIGHT OF THE WAR IN  IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN.  >> I WANT TO BRING DAVID BACK IN FROM THE PENTAGON.  TELL US ABOUT THE DECISION- MAKING LEADING UP TO THE  STRIKING TODAY.  >> THEY BEGAN ON SUNDAY, WITH  THE DEADLY ATTACK, AND I THINK  FROM THEN ON, RETALIATION WAS  JUST A MATTER OF TIME AND  PLANNING.  ON MONDAY, BEFORE HE LEFT ON A  TRIP, I BELIEVE IT WAS TO  FLORIDA, PRESIDENT BIDEN MET  WITH HIS NATIONAL SECURITY  ADVISERS, AND HE CAME OUT OF  THAT MEETING AND SAID THAT HE  HAD DECIDED ON HIS RESPONSE.  AND FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK, I  HAVE HEARD IT HERE, ESSENTIALLY  WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE SAID THIS  EVENING, THAT THE TIMING WAS  DETERMINED FROM THEN ON BY WHAT  THEY WERE WAITING FOR GOOD  WEATHER, SO PILOTS CAN HAVE  EYES ON THEIR TARGETS, HAVING  EYES ON TARGETS IS NOT  ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL, YOU CAN  DROP A GPS-GUIDED BOMB, BUT IF  YOU HAVE EYES ON YOUR TARGET  YOU HAVE A SAFEGUARD AGAINST  CIVILIANS DRIVING INTO THE  TARGET AREA AT THE LAST MOMENT.  THIS THING WAS JUST WAITING  FROM THE WEAPON FROM MONDAY, ON, AND EARLY ON THIS AFTERNOON OUR  TIME, ABOUT MIDNIGHT IN IRAQ  AND SYRIA, WOULD BE A GOOD TIME  FOR THE WEATHER TO BE CLEAR  ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THESE KINDS  OF ATTACKS.  >> IN THE FINAL FEW SECONDS  WAITING ON THE WEATHER IS ONE  THING, BUT IT CREATED A GAP  WHICH ALLOWED LEADERSHIP THAT  WAS IN THE REGION TO FLEE, OR  SEEK SOME KIND OF SHELTER WHEN  THESE STRIKES CAME?  >> IT DID.  THE TARGET LIST DOESN'T SOUND  LIKE THEY EVEN TRIED TO GO  AFTER SOME OF THE LEADERS, BUT  HERE'S THE THING,  CATHERINE.  IF  THOSE LEADERS WANT TO  RESUME THEIR ATTACKS AGAINST  AMERICAN TROOPS, THEY WILL HAVE  TO COME OUT OF HIDING SOMETIME.  IF THESE STRIKES FOLLOW WHAT  ARE CONDUCTED ARE SUCCESSFUL,  THEN THEY WON'T HAVE MUCH TO  WORK WITH WHEN THEY COME OUT OF  HIDING.  >> DAVID MARTIN, NANCY CORDES,  AND SAM VINNIGRAD, THANK YOU  FOR YOUR REPORTING'S.  >>> OVER 30 DRONE ATTACKS  CARRIED OUT BY IRAN-BACKED  HOUTHI REBELS, HAVE TAKEN  PART  OVER THE RED SEA.  MORE ON A THREAT ASSESSMENT.  >> Reporter: ONE POSSIBILITY  WOULD BE A RESPONSIBLE RESPONSE  FROM HEZBOLLAH ALONG THE  ISRAELI BORDER.  ISRAELI MILITARY HAS BEEN  TRADING FIRE WITH HEZBOLLAH  FIGHTERS SINCE THE HAMAS  ATTACK, OCTOBER 7th, AND  INCREASINGLY, THERE HAS BEEN A  LOT OF RATTLING OF SABERS.  TROOPS IN THE NORTH, PRIME  MINISTER NETANYAHU HAS  THREATENED TO TURN BEIRUT INTO  GAZA.  IF ISRAEL RAGES WERE AGAINST  THEM, SAYS THE LEADER, IT WILL  BE COSTLY.  ISRAEL HAS AN ARSENAL OF OVER  150,000 MISSILES, ACCORDING TO  ISRAELI OFFICIALS, FIVE TIMES  LARGER, AND FOR MORE ACCURATE,  THAN WHAT HAMAS USES IN GAZA,  CATHERINE.  >> DEBORA PATTA REPORTING, IN  TEL AVIV.   >>> SENIOR ANALYST FOR AVANTI  GROUP,  YOU KNOW THE REGION  PROBABLY AS WELL AS ANYONE  ELSE.  >> YEAH, I THINK THE MESSAGE  WERE A CLEAR MESSAGE FROM THE  BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TO REACH  DETERRENCE.  IT WAS NOT A SURPRISE, IT WAS  IN THE TALKS FOR A WHILE, BUT I  THINK IRAN AND MILITIAS ARE  FINALLY SEEING THE CONSEQUENCES  AND OUTCOMES OF KILLING THEIR  SOLDIERS.  >> STRIKES HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN  IRAQ, AND ALSO SYRIA.  >> YES.  >> HOW CLOSE ARE THE TIES  BETWEEN THE PROXY GROUP IN  SYRIA AND LEADERSHIP IN IRAN?  >> IN IRAQ, THE STRIKES, AND IN  SYRIA, THE AREAS STRUCK HAVE  BEEN AREA OF INFLUENCE OR  CONTROL SINCE SPRING, 2011, IN  2017 AND 2018 WHERE RESEARCH  WAS BEING CONDUCTED IN, WE SAW  THAT IRAN STARTED DOING DAY-TO- DAY AFFAIRS OF MANAGING THOSE  AREAS TO THE POINT WHERE WE HAD  IDP'S RETURNING TO ISRAELI  OFFICIALS, STAMPING SEAL OF  APPROVALS TO RETURN A MUSCLE  TARGETED AREAS WERE AREAS UNDER  IRANIAN INFLUENCE FOR A WHILE.  >> WHAT YOU HEAR FROM U.S.  OFFICIALS IN WASHINGTON IS THAT  THERE IS A DISCONNECT BETWEEN  THE IRANIAN LEADERSHIP AND  THESE PROXY GROUPS, THEY MAY  ARM THEM, FUND THEM, SUPPLY  THEM, BUT THEY DON'T HAVE  CONTROL OVER THE TARGET SET.  YOU ARE DESCRIBING A CLOSER  RELATIONSHIP.  >> THAT'S A CLOSER RELATIONSHIP  IN SYRIA.  EVERY GROUP IS DIFFERENT WHEN  IT COMES TO THEIR RELATIONS  WITH IRAN, AND YEMEN, THE  HOUTHI, THEY CALL THEMSELVES,  ARE  DIRECTLY CONTROLLED BY IRAN COMPARED TO HEZBOLLAH. LEBANON  RECEIVES A DIRECT BUDGET FROM  IRAN.  IN YEMEN, THOUGH HOUTHI REBELS  ARE NOT  AS CONTROLLED BY IRAN,  BUT THEY DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT  THEY RECEIVE WEAPONS AND  TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGY, AND  OTHER MEANS OF SUPPORTS.  >> BEFORE YOU CAME ON THE SET  YOU SAID SOMETHING THAT STOOD  OUT TO ME, YOU SAID THE VIEW IN  THE MIDDLE EAST SAID THIS IS A  U.S.-LED OPERATION, IT DOES NOT  HAVE THE FEEL OF A GLOBAL  COALITION, BACKING OF RUSSIA OR  CHINA, SOMEONE WHO WAS A CLOSE  ALLY TO IRAN.  WHY DOES THAT MATTER?  >> A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE LOOKING  FOR CHINA TO PLAY A BIGGER ROLE  CONSIDERING MUCH OF THE TRADE  THAT GOES THROUGH IS CHINESE  TRADE, BUT THIS GOES BACK TO  THE QUESTION OF IF THE U.S.  WILL NOT BE PLAYING THE POLICE  ROLE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, WHO  WILL BE?  >> DOES IT REQUIRE A GLOBAL  COALITION--  >> YES.  AND, THE HOPE IS, IT'S VERY  HARD TO TELL AT THIS POINT  WHERE THE STRIKES WILL LEAD TO.  WILL IT LEAD TO MAXIMUM  PRESSURE TO WHERE YOU DE- ESCALATE, OR WILL IT LEAD TO  FOR THE CONFLICT?  WE ARE AT A CROSSROADS, THIS IS  UNCHARTED TERRITORY.  >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANALYSIS.  >>> A SENIOR HAMAS OFFICIAL  SAYS THE GROUP WILL \"RESPOND  SOON TO A DEAL INCLUDING CEASE- FIRE AND HOSTAGE RELEASES.\"  DRAFTED BY OFFICIALS IN ISRAEL,  U.S., QATAR, IT CALLS FOR A SIX- WEEK PAUSE IN FIGHTING AND  RELEASE OF PALESTINIAN  PRISONERS HELD BY ISRAEL AT A  RATE OF THREE PRISONERS PER  HOSTAGE.

THE U.S. HAS MOVED CLOSER TO RETALIATING FOR A DRONE ATTACK THAT KILLED THREE AMERICAN TROOPS IN JORDAN. PRESIDENT BIDEN SAID HE'S DECIDED HOW TO RESPOND. AS HE LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE, HE SAID IRAN SHARES THE BLAME BECAUSE U.S. OFFICIALS BELIEVE AND IRAN BACKED MILITIA LAUNCHED THE ATTACK. BUT HE STOPPED SHORT OF SAYING TEHRAN IS A TARGET. >> I DO HAVE -- SUPPLYING THE WEAPONS TO THE PEOPLE WHO DID IT. I DON'T THINK WE NEED A WIDER WAR ON THE MIDDLE EAST. >> THE IRAQI MILITIA BLAME FOR THE ATTACK ANNOUNCED IT IS SUSPENDING STRIKE AGAINST U.S. FORCES IN THE REGION. THE PENTAGON SAID ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS. IN THE OCCUPIED WEST BANK, SURVEILLANCE VIDEO SHOWED ISRAELI COMMANDOS INSIDE A HOSPITAL IN THE CITY OF JANINE DISGUISED AS CIVILIAN WOMEN AND MEDICS. THREE PALESTINIAN MILITANTS WERE KILLED. IN SOUTHERN GAZA, FIGHTING RAGED WHILE THE ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER RULED OUT ANY MILITARY WITHDRAWAL. >> I HEAR SAYINGS ABOUT ALL SORTS OF DEALS. I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR WE WILL NOT END THE WAR WITHOUT ACHIEVING OUR GOALS. WE WILL NOT PULL OUT THE IDF FROM THE GAZA STRIP AND WE WILL NOT RELEASE THOUSANDS OF HER -- TERRORISTS. >> THE LEADER OF HAMAS SAID HE WILL MEET WITH MEDIATORS TO REVIEW THE LATEST CEASE-FIRE PROPOSAL. WE ARE JOINED BY NICK SCHIFRIN. LET'S START WITH THE ATTACK THAT KILLED THE THREE U.S. SOLDIERS. WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HOW THE ADMINISTRATION PLANS TO RESPOND? >> OFFICIALS SAY THE CHALLENGE IS TO REESTABLISH DETERRENCE AGAINST THESE GROUPS WITHOUT GOING TO WAR WITH IRAN ITSELF. WHAT COULD THAT LOOK LIKE? I'M ABOUT TO DESCRIBE THE BROAD CATEGORIES OF TARGETS. A GROUP OF TARGETS IS IRANIAN BACKED GROUPS IN IRAQ AND SYRIA. THESE ARE IRAQIS AND SYRIANS WHO FIGHT FOR THESE GROUPS, WHOSE WEAPONS AND FINANCING OFTEN COMES FROM IRAN. THE SECOND CATEGORY IS IRANIAN ASSETS IN IRAQ AND SYRIA. THERE ARE IRANIANS FROM IRAN'S REVOLUTIONARY GUARD COURSE, THAT RUN CENTERS IN THESE PLACES, THAT RUN WEAPON SITES. THESE ARE OBVIOUSLY IRANIANS RUNNING THESE LEASES. SOME ARE IN DAMASCUS AND BAGHDAD WHERE THE COMMANDERS FLY IN. THERE ARE ALSO MORE RURAL TARGETS. THE THIRD CATEGORY WOULD BE IRAN ITSELF. EVERYTHING FROM THE IRGC HEADQUARTERS IN DOWNTOWN TEHRAN, TO IRANIAN NAVAL SHIPS, INCLUDING A SHIP OF FORMER MILITARY OFFICIAL TELLS ME IS HELPING THE WHO THESE IN YEMEN. TODAY, JOHN KIRBY SAID THE RESPONSE WOULD BE TIERED. MULTIPLE ACTIONS OVER TIME. THAT SUGGESTS MORE THAN ONE ROUND. THEY ARE ALSO LOOKING AT THAT STATEMENT YOU MENTIONED. THE MOST LIKELY GROUP THAT TARGETED THE TROOPS IN JORDAN THIS WEEKEND SAYING THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO FIRE ON U.S. TROOPS. THIS IS A SIGN SOME REGIONAL OFFICIALS BELIEVE IRAN DOESN'T WANT TO ESCALATE, BUT SENIOR ADMINISTRATION TELLS ME THEY ARE MONITORING THAT STATEMENT. THE PENTAGON SAY ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS. >> HAMAS ANNOUNCED IT WOULD GO TO CAIRO TO ENGAGE IN THOSE TALKS. DOES IT SIGNAL THEY ARE TAKING IT SERIOUSLY? >> THEY HOPE IT MEANS HAMAS IS TAKING IT SERIOUSLY. THE DETAILS WE HAVE NOW HAVE BEEN PROVIDED BY UNOFFICIAL BRIEFED ON THE TALKS. THE HOSTAGE RELEASES WOULD OCCUR OVER THREE PHASES. OLDER WOMEN AND CHILDREN. MEN AND YOUNGER WOMEN WOULD BE THE SECOND PHASE. SOLDIERS AND DEAD BODIES WOULD BE THE THIRD. THE FIRST WOULD LAST SIX WEEKS. IT MEANS THE WAR WOULD ACTUALLY STOP FOR SIX WEEKS WITH ASSURANCES A PAUSE IN FIGHTING WOULD CARRY ON TO PHASE TWO AND THREE. DESPITE WHAT YOU READ, ISRAEL HAS AGREED TO THIS FRAMEWORK ON PAPER. THAT IS WHY THE BALL IS IN THE COURT OF HAMAS. THAT MEETING IS KEY AND WILL DECIDE WHETHER THE DEAL GOES FORWARD. IT IS BEING MEDIATED BY QATAR. A SHORT TIME AGO, I SPOKE WITH THE SPOKESPERSON FOR THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS IN QATAR. I ASKED HOW SIGNIFICANT IT WAS THAT THESE PRINCIPLES WERE IN PLACE. >> I CAN TELL YOU WE ARE OUT A GOOD MOMENT. WE ARE AT THE POINT WHERE A LOT OF THINGS HAVE ELUDED US FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS. I THINK AFTER WHAT WE SAW, HAMAS ANNOUNCING RECEIVING THE DRAFTS AND DISCUSSING IT. THAT WAS A POINT WHERE WE WERE FAR FROM A COUPLE OF WEEKS BACK. NOW WE HAVE A GENERAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEXT PHASE AND HOW THAT WILL PLAY OUT. I WOULD SAY IT IS VERY SIGNIFICANT. AS LONG AS THE PROCESS IS ONGOING, WE HAVE PROCESSES GOING BACK AND FORTH, WE KNOW THERE IS A LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL THAT WE CAN GET TWO ASSAYS -- SUSTAINABLE IDEA. >> HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO REVIEW THE DRAFT AND IS FLYING TO CAIRO TO DISCUSS WITH THEIR MILITARY COMMANDERS. BUT THEY HAVE REITERATED THE SAME POINT. THEY WANT A PERMANENT CEASE-FIRE AS PART OF THIS DEAL. AND UNTIL THAT IS IN THE DEAL, THEY WILL REJECT IT. HOW DO YOU GET OVER OR CONVINCE THEM TO GO OVER THAT CONCERN? >> WE HAVE BEEN MEDIATING BETWEEN THE SIDES SINCE 2006 WHEN THE U.S. ASKED US TO OPEN THE CHANNEL COMMUNICATION. WE'VE GROWN TO UNDERSTAND THE PATTERNS OF NEGOTIATIONS. YOU WILL HEAR A LOT OF STATEMENTS, THE IMPORTANT THING IS THE MEDIATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN KEY TO THE PROCESS ITSELF. WE ARE LISTENING TO WHAT YOU ARE GETTING FROM BOTH SIDES. WE BELIEVE THE LANGUAGE BUILDS UPON THE PROPOSALS FROM BOTH SIDES DURING THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. >> ARE THEY STILL INSISTING A PERMANENT CEASE-FIRE? >> USUALLY YOU GET A YES BUT FROM BOTH SIDES. BUT I'M QUITE SURE WE ARE ON THE RIGHT LINE. >> WE HEARD FROM PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU REITERATING ISRAEL'S GOALS OF ELIMINATING HAMAS AND RELEASING THE HOSTAGES. HE SAID THE ISRAELI MILITARY WILL NOT WITHDRAW FROM THE GAZA STRIP. DOES IT PREVENT THE DEAL FROM HAPPENING? >> IT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO TAKE EVERYTHING SAID IN FRONT OF CAMERAS AT FACE VALUE. I KNOW WE ARE SPEAKING IN FRONT OF CAMERAS. BUT THERE IS A LOT OF PROPAGANDA, POLITICIZE ASIAN ABOUT THIS AND ADHERING TO OTHER THAN THE THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION. >> LET'S LOOK AT REGIONAL ISSUES. PRESIDENT BIDEN SAID HE DECIDED HOW TO RESPOND TO THIS ATTACK IN JORDAN THAT KILLED THREE U.S. SERVICE MEMBERS. YESTERDAY, THE PRIME MINISTER SPEAKING IN WASHINGTON URGED DE-ESCALATION. WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE TO THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION AS THEY ARE ABOUT TO LAUNCH THE STRIKE? >> WE UNDERSTAND HOW DANGEROUS AND PROBLEMATIC IT IS. WE ARE MEMBERS IN THE COALITION AGAINST ISIS AND OUR MILITARY PERSONNEL. >> THESE U.S. SOLDIERS ARE ACTUALLY COUNTER ISIS? >> CORRECT. WE CANNOT TAKE THIS LIGHTLY. WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE BIGGER PICTURE. ALL OF IT IS A BYPRODUCT OF WHAT IS HAPPENING. THIS REGION, THE MIDDLE EAST, IT IS THE CAPITAL OF ALL CRISIS IN THE WORLD. WE ARE AT A SITUATION WHERE THE PEOPLE IN THE REGION CANNOT TAKE ANYMORE REFUGEE CRISIS, CANNOT TAKE ANYMORE SECURITY CHALLENGES, CANNOT TAKE WARS. RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE A FAILURE OF THE CENTRAL STATE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE WE DE-ESCALATE. ANY ESCALATION IN THE REGION CAN RESULT IN OPEN WAR. WE FULLY UNDERSTAND THE UNITED STATES HAS TO REESTABLISH THE DETERRENCE IN THE REGION. BUT WE ARE ALSO TALKING TO PARTNERS IN THE ADMINISTRATION AND AROUND THE WORLD ABOUT THE NEED FOR A RESPONSE TO BE MEASURED AND TO TALK ABOUT THIS AND GET THE MESSAGES ACROSS. >> READY U.S. OFFICIALS DON'T BELIEVE IT IS ABOUT GAZA, THAT IT IS ABOUT IRAN. IRAN PUSHING THESE OR SUPPLYING THE INFORMATION, INTELLIGENCE, THE WEAPONRY TO THE IRANIAN BACKED PROXIES IN IRAQ, SYRIA TO BE ABLE TO LAUNCH THESE ATTACKS. IRAN HAS BEEN ABLE -- HAS BEEN HELPING THESE GROUPS. THE U.S. IS ABOUT TO HIT THESE GROUPS. WHAT IS THE OFFRAMP IN QATAR'S VIEW FOR WHAT WE ARE ABOUT TO SEE INCREASING ESCALATION? >> THE IMPORTANT THING IS MEASURING THE RESPONSE AND NOT TO ANTAGONIZE ALL SIDES IN THE REGION FOR OPEN WAR. WHILE I UNDERSTAND THERE IS A LOT OF EMOTIONAL LINKS TO THIS, WE UNDERSTAND WHEN THIS CRISIS STARTED, THIS IS WHEN THE ESCALATION STARTED. AND UNLESS WE DEFUSE THE ORIGINAL CRISIS LIKE THE WAR ON GAZA, A LOT OF ESCALATIONS WILL UTILIZE THAT TO CONDUCT SUCH A TASK. >> I WILL ASK YOU ABOUT COMMENTS BY BENJAMIN NETANYAHU. THIS WAS LEAKED AUDIO TO A GROUP OF FAMILY MEMBERS AND HOSTAGES HELD IN GAZA. HE SAID YOU DON'T HEAR ME THINKING QATAR, THEY HAVE LEVERAGE BECAUSE THEY FINANCED HAMAS. I'VE ASKED YOU A VERSION OF THE QUESTION. BUT CRITICS OF YOURS SAY YOU ARE AN ARSONIST AND A FIREFIGHTER. YOU'RE COMING INTO TRY AND MEDIATE, BUT YOU ARE THE ARSONIST IN THE SENSE YOU ARE SUPPORTING HAMAS. >> IF YOU ACCUSE QATAR OF SUPPORTING HAMAS WITH FUNDING DONE TO AID, THE SAME ACCUSATION WOULD GO TO ISRAEL ITSELF. EVERYTHING THAT WENT TO AID WAS DONE IN COORDINATION WITH ISRAEL, THE MONEY WENT TO ISRAELI BANKS TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE ENOUGH TO WORK ON MEDIATION. THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE DONE SINCE 2006. BUT I CAN TELL YOU WHEN WE HEAR THESE WORDS COMING FROM THE PRIME MINISTER, THE ONLY THING WE SEE IS A POLITICIZATION OF THIS CRISIS. HE HAS MADE SUCH STATEMENTS ABOUT QATAR ON THE EVE OF A DOUBLE DOWN -- A DOUBLE DOWN ON THESE STATEMENTS, HE'S SENDING HIS CHIEF OF INTELLIGENCE TO MEET WITH QATAR INTERMEDIATION. WHILE HE'S ENGAGED, IF HE'S SINCERE ABOUT WHAT HE'S SAYING, CAN HE ANSWER THE QUESTION ABOUT WHY HE WORKED WITH QATAR ON THE FUNDING OF THE AID PROGRAMS IN GAZA? WHY HE'S WORKING NOW, AND EVEN ON THE 28TH OF SEPTEMBER LAST YEAR, HIS GOVERNMENT WAS ENGAGED IN MEDIATION QATAR WAS DOING BETWEEN HAMAS AND ISRAEL. IT IS UNACCEPTABLE, BUT WE HAVE GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO IT.

"uploader": "DaJobnik", "transcript": "welcome to dnik your command post for clarity and perspective since the beginning of the war the kisala terrorist organization has aligned itself with Hamas and has chosen to commit acts of Terror against Israel kisala is trying to divert our attention from the war in Gaza disrupting the life of Israeli residents of the north the aggression and attacks carried out by kisala are fully backed by Iran and are the service to the Iranian regime that wishes to harm Israel over the last three months kisala has attacked the North of Israel relentlessly firing Rockets mortars and anti-tank missiles at Israeli communities and Military outposts these acts of terrorism are taking place in parallel to Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza have led to an internal displacement of many many Israeli civilians who have not been able to safely return to their homes therefore the IDF responding in self-defense has engaged in very intense fighting on the Northern front with the goal of reshaping security of the area that residents of the north can safely return to their homes this is the Lebanese border and this is the area of thousand Lebanon where the Lani and zaran River flow according to the UN Security Council resolution 1701 following the second Lebanon war the presence of armed kisala operatives south of the Lani river is prohibited despite the UN resolution kisala turned sou Lebanon into its main stronghold and build a number of Terr systems in this area from military posts to military bases to weapon facilities while launching rockets that threatened the state of Israel as the Gaza War Began understanding that kisala may seek to perpetrate Terror against our population we deployed a large number of Land Air Naval intelligence forces along the northern border and indeed kisala launched attacks against Israel and joined the war in response to these attacks and using preemptive strikes the IDF has been operating to destroy their operational capabilities in southern Lebanon since the beginning of the war the IDF has carried out three main efforts in the north the defensive effort during which we have created a new defensive measures along the border the offensive effort during which we have targeted kis bala's forces and are damaging its military capabilities and the Readiness effort to prepare for a war on the northern border since October 7th we have been engaging in a new defensive effort along the border with Lebanon to protect residents of the north and damage kis bala's capabilities in this context we have deployed three divisions along the border we are preventing kis bala's attacks along the border attempting to enter into Israel to fire anti-tank missiles towards Israeli communities IDF positions and to launch rockets at Israel so far we have struck more than 150 terrorist cells and eliminated over 200 terrorists and commanders in southern lebano our policy is clear those who pose a threat will be targeted the second effort is our offensive operations since the start of the war we have struck over 3,400 military targets belonging to the kisala organizations across the southern Lebanon looking at the sou Lebanon it is a complex area with several towns and communities most of which are connected to the Shia population in Lebanon like Hamas kisala has also embedded its terrorist infrastructure with the civilian population in Lebanon to make it difficult to Target kisala military assets our strikes are carried out based on precise intelligence with the goal of damaging kis bala's capability not causing harm to the civilian population we know how to strike any site used by kisala for terrorist activities we are striking three main group of kisala targeted the first is kis bala's forces along the border this includes kis bala's observation and offensive positions which are used to attack Israeli communities we have targeted about 120 OB observation positions along the border the second group of targets is kis bala's weapon storage facilities these facilities are used to store various weapons including missiles with various ranges uavs weapons and explosives since the beginning of the war we have targeted destroyed about 40 weapon storages that kisala he along the border pris bala's weapon storages facilities were struck you can see the secondary explosions caused by the detonation of the missil stored in this site the third group of targets is kis bala's military command and control centers which are the heart of the organization's military activities used to manage attacks kisala forces against Israel in both war and routine situation so far we have struck over 40 command and control centers used by Terror operatives we are also targeting significant Central infrastructures belonging to kisala including the terrorist organization's aerial unit responsible for launching uavs towards Israeli territory in one strike we targeted an air strip used by the unit and eliminated the head ofis bala's Southern Lebanon aerial unit in this video you can see terrorists unloading uavs from a vehicle moving them into civilian building in the heart of a Lebanese town and preparing them for a launch the Israeli Air Force strike the terrorists and stopped the launch attempt kisala endangers the residents of sou Lebanon and we will continue to operate to prevent the terror of kisala there as well with wrock a facility used to store Advanced surface to a missiles that kisala he intending to harm operations of the Israeli Air Force the IDF has been striking other sensitive targets belonging to kisala which I cannot detail to for security reasons in parallel to strikes in Lebanon we are operating to stop the supply chain ofis bala's weapons and missiles most of these weapons are smuggled by land and air from Iran to Syria and from there into Lebanon in clear violation of UN resolution 1701 Iran provides weapons to all the proxies in the Middle East these weapons are not only used against the state of Israel but against all of the Middle East we have witnessed Iran's proxies posing the threat to both Regional and international stability occasionly Hamas operatives in Syria attempt to smuggle weapons into Lebanon we identify these deliveries and targeted them using various methods which I will not detail before they reach kisala we are targeting kisala infrastructures in Syria as well since the beginning of the war we have struck more than 50 such targets across Syria from the air and the land we are also operating to ensure our operational achievements and to prevent kisala from rebuilding we will continue to operate wherever kisala is we will continue to operate throughout the Middle East preventing all threats on Israel what is true for Lebanon is true for Syria and it is true for additional places further away for example about a month ago we eliminated kis bala's cell in Syria the third and final effort is increasing our Readiness for war while we would prefer diplomatic Solutions we will not hesitate to respond with Force war is not our first priority yet we are ready for it for the past three months the northern command is cooperating with the Israeli Air Force the intelligence the Israeli Navy and other branches of the IDF has been conducting a series of training and exercises to ensure that if given the order we can transition to an immediate and significant operation all the efforts I have described have already LED an improved security situation in the north which will continue to take shape in the future we we will not return to the security situation on October 6th when kisala threatened Israeli civilians in the north and deceived the world kisala made grave mistake when he decided to stand with Hamas partnering with kidnappers and rapists who carried out an unprovoked and immoral attack on Israel we have made the decision to focus on Gaza and the efforts to dismantle us this decision is still valid that is where the 136 hostages are and our ultimate mission is to bring them home just as we are responsible to keep our citizens safe kisala is responsible for the price the Lebanese civilians May pay kisala is turning sou Lebanon into a terrorist stronghold just as we have fought against Kamas strongholds in Gaza we will not accept the danger posed to our residents and we will fight kisala and all other terrorist groups that wish to harm Israel we will return to security using all means at our disposal don't forget to like share and

MIKE POMPEO  NOW FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND GET YOUR TAKE AS TO WHAT IS  HAPPENING AND WHAT YOU THINK THE WHITE HOUSE AND PENTAGON WILL  SAY TODAY. >> BILL AND DANA, THANK YOU FOR  HAVING ME ON THIS MORNING. IT IS PRETTY CLEAR THE BIDEN  ADMINISTRATIONS POLICIES HAVE  RESULTED IN A HUGE  CONFLAGRATION. WHETHER WE END UP AT WAR WITH  IRAN. THE IRANIANS ARE AT WAR WITH THE UNITED STATES TODAY. THEY HAVE NOW KILLED AMERICAN  SERVICEMEN. THESE THREE CERTAINLY IN THE  PAST DAYS AND THE TWO NAVY SEALS THAT LOST THEIR LIVES IN THE  EFFORTS IN THE REGION AS WELL. DANA AND BILL. IF WE CONTINUE TO BE REACTIVE  AND CONTINUE TO SAY GOSH, WHEN  THEY DO SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE THE  IRANIANS WILL CONTINUE AT THIS. IT WILL NOT ONLY BE IN ISRAEL  AND GAZA, IT WILL BE ALL ACROSS  THE WORLD. THREE THE WORLD'S LARGEST STATE  SPONSOR OF TERROR DEEPLY  CONNECTED TO IRAN AND CHINA. I THINK WE'RE RISKING ESCALATION CONTINUING IN THE WAY WE'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN IN THE PAST WEEKS. >> Bill: A COUPLE OF THINGS  HERE. THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO NOT TO  GIVE THIS ESCALATE MORE THAN IT  HAS. THE MISSILE RANGE IRAN HAS  TODAY. QUITE STUNNING. BALLISTIC AND CRUISE MISSILES. IF YOU WANT TO MAKE THE CASE  THEY COULD HIT EASTERN INDIA AND HIT MAINLAND EUROPE. THE AXIS OF RESISTANCE. THIS IS THE ROUTE THAT IRAN HAS  USED AND PART OF THE REASON WHY  OUR U.S. TROOPS ARE THERE. 3500 OF THEM TRYING TO PREVENT  THEM FROM RESUPPLYING HEZBOLLAH  IN LEBANON OR FORCES IN SYRIA  AND SUPPLYING FORCES IN THE WEST BANK THERE JUST WEST OF WHERE  YOU SEE JORDAN ON THE MAP. JACK KEANE LAST HOUR SAID YOU  HAVE TO HIT THE RIGHT TARGET. MITCH MCCONNELL SAID HIT THEM  HARD. LINDSEY GRAHAM SAYS YOU HAVE TO  GO AFTER IRAN INSIDE OF IRAN. WHEN YOU TRY TO BALANCE NOT  ESCALATING A WIDER MIDDLE EAST  WAR WITH THE RESPONSE TO GET  IRAN TO BACK DOWN. HOW DO YOU CALCULATE THAT? >> BILL, I'VE HAD TO DO THAT. I'VE BEEN SITTING IN THE SAME  SPOT SECRETARY BLINKEN IS IN  TODAY ADVISING PRESIDENT BIDEN. I WAS ADVISING PRESIDENT TRUMP. TWO THOUGHTS. IT MATTERS WHO THE DETERER IS. THE SAME STRIKE TAKEN BY OUR  ADMINISTRATION WILL FEEL  DIFFERENT TO THE IRANIANS THAN  ONE TAKEN BY PRESIDENT BIDEN  BECAUSE OF AFGHANISTAN, BECAUSE  OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN EUROPE. HE IS PERCEIVED AS WEAK INSTEAD  OF STRONG. I THINK THAT LEADS TO A STRONGER RESPONSE BEING REQUIRED. WHETHER IT'S INSIDE IRAN OR  COMMERCIAL TARGETS IN THE GULF  OR IRANIAN ASSETS AROUND THE  WORLD, THIS WILL HAVE TO BE A  SERIOUS RESPONSE AT SCALE  DETERMINED LIKELY OVER TIME OR  IT WILL JUST LOOK LIKE HEY,  WE'RE WAITING FOR YOU TO KILL  MORE AMERICANS AND WE'LL FIRE AT EMPTY WAREHOUSES IN SYRIA. A GREAT MISTAKE FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I WISH IT WAS THE CASE THAT WHAT HAPPENED IN TEHRAN STAYED IN  TEHRAN. THE UNITED STATES WILL HAVE TO  LEAD. WE WILL GET OUR PARTNERS AND  FRIENDS TO BE ALONG WITH US IF  WE DEMONSTRATE THAT RESOLVE  ADEQUATELY, BILL. >> Dana: THE WHITE HOUSE WILL  BRIEF AT 1:30, PENTAGON AT 2:30. OVER THE WEEKEND THERE WAS  REPORTS THAT THERE WERE ACTUAL  STAFF MEMBERS OF THE U.N.  REFUGEE AGENCIES THAT SUPPOSEDLY HELPS TAKE CARE OF THE  PALESTINIANS BUT NOW YOU HAVE 12 COUNTRIES PAUSING FUNDING  INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES. AUSTRIA, JAPAN ADDED TO THAT  LIST AND NOW HERE IS THE ISRAEL  DOSSIER DETAILING U.N. STAFFERS  INVOLVED IN THE HAMAS ATTACK. WATCH HERE. ONE U.N. STAFFER KIDNAPPED AN  ISRAELI WOMAN. ONE U.N. STAFFER RAIDED A  KIBBUTZ AND PARTICIPATED IN  VIOLENCE. ONE DOLED OUT AMMUNITION TO  HAMAS FIGHTERS IN ADDITION TO  THE OTHER SUPPORT. >> Bill: JUST UNBELIEVABLE. >> Dana: YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. >> HEARD YOU SAY UNBELIEVABLE. SADLY I'M NOT SURPRISED IN THE  LEAST. IT IS THE VERY REASON WE STOPPED FUNDING THEM IN THE TRUMP  ADMINISTRATION. THIS IS KNOWN. WE HAVE KNOWN IT WAS A CORRUPT  INSTITUTION. THE DIFFERENCE EMPLOYEE BETWEEN  SOMEONE WORKING ON BEHALF OF THE IRANIANS AND A PART OF THE U.N.  WE KNEW IT WAS GOING TO  EDUCATING. WE SHOULD HAVE STOPPED FUNDING  THIS ORGANIZATION. WE DID. BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TURNED IT  BACK ON AND HERE IS THE DIRECT  RESULT. I WON'T BE SHOCKED AT ALL IF WE  LEARN THERE WASN'T JUST A DOZEN, BUT DOZENS AND DOZENS AND DOZENS OF U.N.

WE'LL GO FIRST TO NBC'S RAF SANCHEZ WHO'S IN TEL AVIV, ISRAEL. WHY, IF WELCOME TO YOU. LOOKING TELLS ABOUT THE HOSTAGE RELEASE? WHERE THEY ARE RIGHT NOW, AND GIVEN THIS HOUR, IT'S JUST PAST THE PM, IS ANYTHING MORE EXPECTED TODAY? >> SO, ALEX, AS YOU MENTION, THIS IS THE THIRD NIGHT IN A ROW IN WHICH WE HAVE SEEN ISRAELI HOSTAGES EMERGING FROM GAZA. IN EXCHANGE, ISRAEL RELEASING PALESTINIAN PRISONERS IN JERUSALEM, IN THE OCCUPIED WEST BANK. ALEX, TONIGHT, THE CHOREOGRAPHY WAS DIFFERENT. MOST OF THOSE HOSTAGES, 13 OF THEM, RATHER THAN GOING SOUTH THROUGH THE RAFAH CROSSING INTO EGYPT, WHICH IS WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST TWO NIGHTS, THEY WERE INSTEAD HANDED OVER TO THE RED CROSS IN NORTHERN GAZA, CLOSER TO GAZA CITY, AND THEY WENT STRAIGHT OVER THE BORDER INTO ISRAEL. FROM THERE, ONE OF THOSE HOSTAGES, AN ELDERLY WOMAN, WAS FLOWN DIRECTLY TO HOSPITAL. SHE APPEARS TO BE IN SERIOUS MEDICAL CONDITION. WE DON'T HAVE THE DETAILS RIGHT NOW. THE OTHER 12 HOSTAGES CONTINUED ON TO AN AIRBASE. NOW, AMONG THOSE WAS THIS LITTLE FOUR-YEAR-OLD ISRAELI AMERICAN GIRL, ABIGAIL IT DON. ALEX, IT IS WORTH JUST PAUSING FOR MOMENT ON HER STORY. NOT JUST BECAUSE SHE'S AN AMERICAN, BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT THIS LITTLE CHILD HAS BEEN THROUGH. BOTH OF HER PARENTS WERE MURDERED IN THE KIBBUTZ ON THE MORNING OF OCTOBER 7TH. HER OLDER SIBLINGS HID ELSEWHERE IN THE HOUSE. THIS LITTLE FOUR-YEAR-OLD WALKED AWAY FROM HER PARENTS BODIES. SHE WENT OVER TO A NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE. SHE HID WITH THEM, ONLY FOR THAT FAMILY TO BE KIDNAPPED. SHE HAS BEEN HELD IN GAZA FOR THE SEVEN WEEKS. OFFICIALS HERE IN ISRAEL IN THE UNITED STATES ARE WORKING TO BRING HER HOME. SHE IS NOW SAFELY BACK INSIDE OF ISRAEL, BUT ALEX, SOMETIME TONIGHT, OR IN THE COMING DAYS, SOMEONE IS GOING TO HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO THIS LITTLE GIRL THAT BOTH OF HER PARENTS ARE DEAD. THAT SHE'S AN ORPHAN. AND THAT SHE HAS A VERY LONG ROAD AHEAD OF HER TO RECOVER FROM WHAT'S GONE ON THESE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. WE ARE ALSO EXPECTING, ALEX, ONE MORE ISRAELI CITIZEN WHO IS A DUAL ISRAELI RUSSIAN NATIONAL, TO BE RELEASED ALONGSIDE THREE THAI WORKERS. THEY WILL TAKE THAT ROUTE THROUGH THE RAFAH CROSSING, THEN BACK INTO ISRAEL. YOU MENTIONED PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU WAS ON THE GROUND INSIDE OF GAZA EARLIER TODAY. WE ARE THE THIRD OF FOUR DAYS OF THE CEASE-FIRE. RIGHT NOW, IF NOTHING CHANGES, THE CEASE-FIRE IS DUE TO EXPIRE AT SEVEN A.M. LOCAL TIME ON TUESDAY. YOU'VE HEARD PRESIDENT BIDEN EARLIER TONIGHT SAYING THAT HE IS OPTIMISTIC, THAT THERE MAY BE A POSSIBILITY OF EXTENDING THE CEASE-FIRE FURTHER ON THIS PRE-AGREED FORMULA. ONE ADDITIONAL DAY A CEASE-FIRE IN EXCHANGE FOR TEN MORE HOSTAGES. RIGHT NOW, NOTHING IS CLEAR. AND UNLESS THE DEAL IS SOLIDIFIED, THE FIGHTING WILL START AGAIN ON TUESDAY MORNING, AS PROMISED BY THE ISRAELI MILITARY. NOW, WE CAN SAY THAT THERE IS THIS ONE ELDERLY WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN FLOWN STRAIGHT TO HOSPITAL, BUT I WANT TO PLAY YOU A LITTLE BIT A SOUND FROM THE DOCTOR WHO IS INVOLVED IN THE TREATMENT OF THE HOSTAGES WHO EMERGED LAST NIGHT. TAKE A LISTEN. >> WE'VE RECEIVED THESE 12 CAPTIVES, CHILDREN, AND WOMEN. THEY CAME BACK. THEY UNDERWENT A MEDICAL EVALUATION, AND EVALUATION. I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE HARSH CONDITIONS THAT THEY'VE BEEN UNDER IN THE EXPERIENCE OF CAPTIVITY, THEY DID NOT REQUIRE ANY EMERGENCY MEDICAL INTERVENTION. >> ALEX, WE SPOKE LAST NIGHT TO THE FAMILY OF OHAD -- HE IS A NINE YEAR OLD BOY. HE WAS RELEASED ON THE FIRST NIGHT OF THESE HOSTAGE EXCHANGE. THIS RELATIVE TOLD US THAT OHAD EXPLAIN TO THEM THAT WHEN THEY WERE IN GAZA, IN THE CAPTIVITY OF HAMAS, THEY WEREN'T PHYSICALLY ABUSE, THEY WEREN'T TORTURED, BUT HE DESCRIBED INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT CONDITIONS. HE SAID AT SOME POINT THEY WERE GOING DAYS WITHOUT FOOD. HE SAID THEY SLEPT ON WOODEN BENCHES, NOT BEDS. LIKE ALL THESE OTHER CHILDREN, HE HAS A LONG ROAD TO RECOVERY AHEAD OF THEM. ALEX. >> 100%. AS I HEAR ABOUT THE STORY OF ABIGAIL, AS YOU ACCURATELY DISCUSSED, THE -- IS THE FAMILY WHO SHE GOT OVER TO YOU. THEY HAD FOUR AT THEIR FAMILY RELEASED TODAY. THAT INCLUDES A TEN YEAR OLD, EIGHT-YEAR-OLD, AND FOUR-YEAR-OLD. GOD WILLING, SHE WAS KEPT WITH THEM. THAT WOULD'VE MADE IT PERHAPS A LITTLE EASIER. FOR THAT MOTHER OR FATHER TO PUT THEIR ARMS AROUND ALL THOSE CHILDREN TOGETHER. VERY QUICKLY, DO YOU THINK THEY WERE RELEASED, THIS GROUP TODAY, DO YOU THINK THEY WERE RELEASED THROUGH THE NORTH BECAUSE OF THE MEDICAL NECESSITY OF THAT ELDERLY HOSTAGE WHO HAD TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL RIGHT AWAY? >> THAT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING. THEY WANTED TO CUT OUT THIS MIDDLE STEP RATHER THAN GOING THROUGH EGYPT, THEY WANTED TO GET THIS OLDER WOMAN OVER THE BORDER, INTO THE HANDS OF THE ISRAELIS AS QUICKLY AS THEY COULD. SHE WAS FLOWN DIRECTLY BY HELICOPTER HOSPITAL HERE IN"}, "EIUecQBtvF4": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIUecQBtvF4", "video_id": "EIUecQBtvF4", "description": "All of the hostages released by Hamas have undergone initial medical assessments and there is \"no risk\" posed to their lives, an IDF spokesperson has confirmed.

them have undergone initial medical assessment at the Karam Shalom crossing point and there is no risk posed to their life they are now in movement and soon they will reach theim base where they will contact their families complete the medical examinations and from them they will flown with Israeli Air Force helicopters to the hospitals to meet with their families the foreign Nationals will also meet their representatives of their countries at theim base and then be transferred to hospitals each and every one of the hostages who have returned home this evening they are a world an entire world of their own and it is our moral duty all the commanders of the IDF and its troops have worked for many weeks together with security agencies to make sure that they return home we mustn't forget this evening that each and every one of those returning home tonight still has a family member or a relative who has been murdered and is held captive in Gaza it is great sadness which is mixed with happiness and excitement the sight of the hostages returning home and Crossing into Israel gave us a great sense of relief and yet our heart goes out to all the other hostages still kept in Gaza and we strengthen the families of the hostages tonight we are constantly thinking about them it is our moral duty to bring them all back home we have just started the process this is the beginning of the process and we are gearing for the rest of the outline nothing is final until it is final until it ends and we must be prepared for that we never forget for one moment that Hamas is a merciless and ruthless enemy more than ever we must avoid spreading any piece of information that hasn't been verified and corroborated for example Han who has returned home this evening after the terror organizations claimed that they have killed her this is what they claimed a few days ago therefore we must rely only on information provided by official agencies and organizations the truth started this morning the commanders of the IDF briefed their soldiers what to do during this pause the Safety and Security of our troops is our topmost priority during the days of the ceasefire the IDF will complete its preparations and reorganization for the next stages IDF troops are deployed and ready our policy is clear we will act against any threat on Israel during the ceasefire we must all remain alert we must not become complacent to continue in the home front to follow the instructions provided by the home front command these are life saving instructions we have informed their families of 392 IDF fatalities so far who were killed in action in the battlefield defending Israel and we remember all these Heroes and heroins of our country on this Shabbat evening it is thanks to what they did it is thanks to their action in the battlefield that we will win our heart goes out to the bed families we continue to support them questions hello this isan zahav from k 11 news first of all it hasn't been published yet what the second stage of the hostage release will include what do you know about this can we uh prevent during the ceasefire a scenario that Hamas activist and leaders will take the hostages and smuggle them into Sinai through the tunnel and what is are the instructions for the troops in the north of the Gaza Strip for the truths we have prepared we have instructed our forces we made sure that the most important thing is the Safety and Security of our troops there are very clear terms and conditions to this ceasefire we are well deployed and we will know how to do whatever is necessary to make sure that this deal this agreement will be carried out of course while keeping to protect our troops and we are preparing for the next stage of this deal like I said nothing is final until it's final we all need to be patient once we have detailed information nitan alon's headquarters who is managing and coordinating everything along with the Mad in the ISA They will receive all the information it will convey them with their families and by the way jeny along with the hostages headquarters led by G we will convey the information to the families and then we will inform the general population just like we did today can the military prevent The Escape of Hamas leaders through the tunnels from Gaza to S we are monitoring and following up on everything we need to monitor we are monitoring the Hamas leaders in Gaza and everywhere else in the world another question with your permission how many gazan citizens managed to return today to the the north of the Gaza Strip we managed to do everything we wanted to do today along the defense line I think the picture is clear there's an agreement here there are very clear terms to this agreement they have been very clearly conveyed and we are con following up on all of the instructions and this is what we did today and this is what we will continue to do in the following days Ella from waa news do you know the reason for the delay in passing on the list of the hostages to be released tomorrow and does that raise any question marks whether that will happen did you receive any guarantees from the US that the US will be able to resume the war in full force after the ceasefire regarding the question regarding our preparations for tomorrow's outline our very best people are working on this I've just returned from nitsan alone Command Center along with people from the Intel and other outstanding individuals they're working on this Around the Clock together with people from the ISA and the mad it's good that we're doing so you need to be patient we will first inform the families and then all of the other Israelis what was your second question did you receive any promise or guarantee from the US that once the ceasefire part is over the IDF will be able to resume combat in full force as it faces International pressure we are preparing for the next phase of the war we are now in a stage of bringing back hostages home it's a very important stage we have very clear goals and the IDF is preparing for the next stages of the war in order to dismantle Hamas to arrange the borders to make sure that we have safe borders and to continue with our important effort to bring back hostages and to reach Regional deterrence these are complex assignments it will take time regarding the us at least on behalf of the IDF I can tell you that we have daily Communications with them very close coordin nation very good understanding we are thinking about the future we're also looking at the entire region things are happening in the region we operate in the region and we are in coordination regarding the next stages But ultimately this war is the state of Israel's war we receive our instructions for the government of Israel this is how we Act and the US understands this as well another question we saw a political debate regarding the two goals of the war does one come before the other what how do things look like now six weeks into the war with respect to the IDF is one goal more important than the other or are they both considered equally important I think that what has happened so far proves itself I think that the ground maneuver the ground action that has led to some very good results in their field significantly so in combination with the Air Force ground forces the north of the Gaza Strip habas has lost control over it we've reached all of their military assets we've dismantled bu the infrastructure of hospitals which were converted into Terror bases we've killed terrorists we've taken ammunitions and means of warfare we have many many achievements almost all of our goals in the north of the Gaza Strip we still have some tunnels to destroy some of them we managed to destroy this morning before the ceasefire entered into effect this is a significant achievement and this achievement also LED through the pressure the success to lead to an outline which we are carrying now today so all these things come together we need to continue with our moral and ethical duty to bring back the hostages but we'll also continue with the war in order to reach all the goals that were opposed to us these are very important goals but it will take time"}, "Nn4pLwCixgA": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn4pLwCixgA", "video_id": "Nn4pLwCixgA", "description": "Hamas released 17

"transcript": "this is an ABC News special report good morning I'm Jonathan Carl we're coming on the air right now with breaking news from the Middle East Hamas has just released 13 Israeli hostages including two Israeli Americans their names of Eva seagull and Abigail Eon Abigail Eon was taken hostage on October 7th when she was just 3 years old her parents killed right in front of her on that day Abigail turned four on Friday but we are told now that she is among those back in Israel and receiving Medical Care additionally four foreign Nationals have been released including three citizens of Thailand and one from Russia this is a fluid situation as we enter day three of the 4-day ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas a transfer of hostages yesterday was was delayed for several hours as Hamas accused Israel of violating the terms of the agreement eventually those differences were worked out out yesterday's exchange included seven Israeli children and six women as well as four citizens of Thailand Israel in turn in turn released 39 Palestinian prisoners and video showed many of them receiving a hero's welcome in the West Bank in the first two days of this ceasefire agreement Hamas has freed a total of 26 Israeli hostages a total of 50 are to be released over the totality of this 4-day ceasefire for more on this we go right to Tel Aviv and Matt Gutman Matt what more can you tell us stand by stand by I'm hey Matt can you hear us I can hey Matt give give us the understand it the as we understand it John the Convoy of Red Cross has driven North in the Gaza Strip delivering 13 is Israelis to a specialized IDF unit 12 of them were then transferred to the kibuts of beri that blitzed out kibuts where uh Hamas attacked on October 7th one of them was flown to Israel via helicopter now another four hostages forign nationalities were driven elsewhere driven South to the Rafa border crossing we understand they're going to go through Egypt unclear where they go after that now it's important to note that we understand that there are two American citizens among those who were released today one of them is Abigail Moore Adan she is 4 years old she just turned four on Friday she was in one of these communities when Hamas attacked her father was shot while holding her in his arms her mother was also murdered that orphan tried to escape she ran to a neighbor's house the neighbors took her in they were taken hostage but her two siblings managed to hide out in a closet they survived they are okay we also understand that Aviva seagull another American she's 62 years old has also been released her husband remains in captivity at this point it was a little bit different than it has been in previous days the red C the Red Cross taking possession of those hostages released by Hamas typically they've been driving them South this time they were picked up directly by an IDF specialized unit this is the third day of these hostage releases and each one of them has been different every day there's been some sort of surprise here but so far John and critically this ceasefire is holding the swaps are progressing of course in exchange Hamas getting 39 prisoners each of these days Palestinians women and teenagers they have been released from Israeli jails and sent to the West Bank where they live that has been received with Jubilation in the West Bank also a lot of aid about 200 trucks a day have been sent in from Egypt into Southern Gaza into the north of Gaza and that was part of the dispute yesterday Hamas said that not enough trucks managed to get from the south of Gaza to the north Gaza they said they wanted more eventually through the mediation of cter Egypt and us that was worked out and the hostages were released but that was a 7-hour standoff with the hostages sitting in those vehicles for hours and lots of concern on both sides that this whole thing would fall through the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin nanyu even con uh convening his War cabinet that's how bad it got but again so far 3 days in the ceasefire is holding the hostages have been released and they're now in Israel John and Matt just as a reminder this is a 4-day ceasefire agreement for the release of some 50 Israeli and Israeli D dual national uh hostages uh in exchange for the release of 150 Palestinian prisoners but the 50 are women and children that was the agreement anyway and I spoke to Jake Sullivan the National Security adviser earlier today who said that there were three three Americans that were to be part of this ENT total two adult women and of course Abigail Edon uh the now four-year-old Abigail Edon do we have any indication uh about that third uh American of of of the American woman that they were hoping to be part of this agreement tell me when you want me to answer John we don't have John we have no indication that the third American has been released we don't know where they are um Israel the United States obviously highly concerned about it they are pressing for the release there is another option that's tomorrow a batch of at least 10 possibly 13 or more hostages could be released others from Far nationalities as well obviously the US has been pushing very hard for the release of Americans um and of course there is the option to extend this ceasefire it's been designed to last for 4 days but Israel has given Hamas the option of extending it for 24 hours for each additional 10 hostages that are released um so that could happen and we understand that it might even happen for two consecutive days all of this remains in the air what we do know for certain is that Israel has made it very clear through its defense minister through its chief of staff and the Prime Minister that as soon as this ceasefire ends hostilities begin they will begin their war on Hamas again again trying to say that they're going to destroy it demolish it completely and try to create a new order of some sort in the Gaza Strip John all right Matt thank you very much we'll get back to you as you learn more but I want to go right now to the White House where obviously President Biden and his National Security team have been following this very closely Mary Alice parks there on the North Lawn Mary Alice what have you learned yeah John no formal statement from the white house yet with this news I wouldn't be surprised if the president came in front of the cameras today he will want to talk about this we know the White House has been making sure that everyone knows the world knows that he has been heavy-handed in this personally involved on the phones yesterday on the phone with the Amir of Qatar uh wanting to make sure that that this was going forward as you were just talking about with Matt John we know from the White House that they were hoping that three Americans in total two women and one child would be released as a part of this deal over the next few days so still obviously there will be pressure for an additional American Israeli dual citizen to be released uh but no doubt this is huge news wonderful news for the White House for the world and they will want to celebrate here it was so interesting listening to the National Security adviser Jake Sullivan on the show with you this morning as he talked about how these families are going to need the world support as their loved ones deal with unbelievable emotional psychological uh trauma after this experience he said that Israel and other countries are pouring resources in to make sure that those families have what they need these hostages now released have what they need uh but they were just talking about the unbelievable unthinkable unspeakable experience that they must have gone through John I mean unspeakable indeed Mary Alison I I know that President Biden had taken a particular interest in the in the plate of Abigail idon who thankfully we hear is is is now safely in Israeli hands uh but he had spoken to her family um I I imagine that's one case in particular we will hear uh the president talk about absolutely because of course she was the youngest of those American hostages uh those dual citizens uh that was taken we know in total 10 American uh hostages nine citizens and one green card holder but Abigail the youngest of the group so such wonderful news that she is among the those released I imagine the president knowing him is probably trying to get in touch with her family right now uh this was clearly a very personal case for him but but the case of all of them I mean this is something that this white house has been working on nonstop his teams have been working on non-stop a huge priority for the president and we've seen his teams are really doing the personal diplomacy too flying throughout the region trying to work on this and talk closely to the Egyptians and the qataris who have been these key mediators in all of this hey thank you very much uh Mary Alice let's go back to Matt Gutman in Tel Aviv Matt what walk us through the process now I mean particularly uh with with Abigail uh Edon you know again just 4 years old uh going through all the hell that she has gone through what what what is the process now as she uh is back in Israeli hands you know they're different processes John for different ages when everybody crosses through the first thing that happens and they've already been inspected by the Red Cross given what they call an optical check they just look at them to see if they K okay and if they need immediate medical assistance then they'll be transferred to the Israelis and that medical team from the is Israeli military unit that met them right there in Gaza itself would give them another cursory medical check and once they cross into Israel there is a whole team of psychologists and additional doctors on call ready to treat them then the adults will be given a quick debrief by Israeli intelligence to ask some quick questions about what they remember the children will not be asked questions they will be handed all of them will be handed phones to make that first phone call with their loved ones for the people who crossed over today it's it's been 51 days since they've spoken to their family members so there's that and then the children especially Abigail moridan she is an orphan remember she's going to be reunited with somebody right there in the base and they're probably going to fly them to Schneider's Children Hospital about 20 minutes from where we are right now and they're going to be separated from the rest of the hospital given some time and some space obviously a massive amount of psychological support but also a lot of love from family members people who are still alive the neighbors that are still alive they're going to try to create a sense of familiarity for her uh get people around her who she knows who she's familiar with and try to just take it very very slowly this Rehabilitation process that could take a very long time especially for someone as young as Abigail but obviously for all of them who've suffered tremendously uh over the past seven weeks John and and Matt when you you think about the the the nature of hearing this news for the families of these hostages so we have uh another uh 13 Israeli Israeli dual National hostages who have been freed that is tremendous news good news relief for those families but the others that were waiting to see whether or not any of their family members were on the list let's remember there are now still uh what another 170 or so hostages being held right now by Hamas you know there's this brutal choreography that goes on John every night before the hostage are released phone calls go out every single family has a military liaison who communicates between them and the military so they know who's on the list and the list goes out from Hamas typically the night before it's not always 100% accurate but it's pretty close so they call everybody everybody to let them know if their loved ones are either on the list or off of the list and this has happened now for three straight nights I suppose it's going to happen again tonight um and for the families who don't know if their loved ones are going to be released it is absolutely Agony so they have been working through this for weeks but all of them tell us that they're like a family at this point and they want to celebrate the wins and successes with the rest of their family and they hope to get their loved ones back at some point but it's going to be very difficult especially for the male soldiers who are left behind in Gaza John all right Matt I want to turn right now we have on the phone David seagull uh he is the brother-in-law of a viiva seagull who has been released one of those released today Mr seagull uh thank you for joining us have you had any contact yet and do you have any more information uh about your sister-in-law I don't have any direct information um my older brother Lee who lives in Israel contacted us earlier when it became known that AA was on the list we were Overjoyed couldn't believe it really we had prepared ourselves for her not to be on the list based on the information in the news and other information we had received um so I don't know more about how she's doing her physical well-being her emotional well-being but we're just ecstatic of course we're heartbroken that my brother Keith is not on the list and um he's 64 we don't know when he'll next be in a grouping that will be released oh just just absolutely heartbreaking 51 days since uh they were were taken hostage by Hamas had you received any indication of of of of even whether or not they were alive confirmation of of anything regarding their condition the only information we' received very early on was there was a piece of a video showing Keith and his wife of via in his car being driven by one of the Hamas terrorists into Gaza away from their cuits where they had been kidnapped but since then we've not had any reliable information about of course their whereabouts but not about their well-being no communication just as been the case with the other hostages very difficult and challenging for us and and that video would have been from October 7th right it was actually posted by Hamas on one of the uh streaming platforms telegram uh and someone who was looking at it noticed and and who knows Keith and aiva said that's Keith's car and that's how we discovered it we're we're all learning of this as it's happening did did you get any advanced notice did you hear about this before the the world found out that your sister-in-law was freed we heard from our family in Israel that they had been notified by the Israeli Defense Force by the army that she had turned up on the list we've had outstanding communication from the state department the Richardson Center the Foley Foundation many updates ever since this all started and they are in the loop as it were as much as anyone and they weren't aware hadn't shared with us that uh she was on the list so it may have happened uh on on relative short short notice that she was on the list it's really it's hard to know so we we had found out but only a little bit before it was already pretty widely disseminated and do you have a sense have they given you an indication of what happens now uh they told us um about how the hostages will well they have the initial assessment very rapid assessment by the Red Cross and then uh the Israeli Army um has inter act with them and then they will be taken to a hospital in Israel for physical and um mental health assessment um their children they have four adult children Keith and aiva they of course know that they've been released I don't know the details of when they'll be able to reunite with their mother um but I think it will be soon after she is um assessed for any kind of physical or emotional needs that are acute well we we certainly hope so and we certainly uh hope that we'll hear news on your brother as well it's got to be an incredibly heart-wrenching bit of news I mean it's it is it's uh amazing and wonderful and wrenching and heartbreaking all at the same time and of course we just ache for the other hostages yeah unbelievable well thank you thank you for taking time to talk to us and and again uh we we wish you all the best we wish uh all the best to to your family and for for good news to come on your brother thank you David seagull thank you hi everyone George Stephanopoulos

"transcript": "we begin with dramatic new images of the hostages released by Hamas these images were put out a short time ago they show Hamas Fighters with their faces covered delivering Israeli hostages to the Red Cross most of the captives appear to be able to walk on their own at least one elderly woman was carried by Hamas fighter to a red cross vehicle the group numbers 24 people including 10 Thai Nationals and one person from the Philippines 133 Israeli women and children were among the freed Israel says it has released 39 Palestinians held in its jails that includes 24 women and 15 teenagers some were convicted by Israel of attempted murder for attacks on Israeli forces some were jailed for offenses such as throwing stones this was the scene outside an Israeli military prison near rala 33 of the 30 9 were freed in the West Bank and transferred to the Red Cross the remaining six were being freed from a Jerusalem facility journalist iris mackler is following developments she joins us live now from Tel Aviv so Iris what do we know about uh the Israeli hostages in terms of where they are now and and where they're going they are on their way to hospital um and that's a precautionary measure and also because they've spent so long seven weeks 49 days you know most of it below ground if if um if the Israeli suppositions are correct so they are to be treated before they and then they will meet their families and then they will be able to I guess if they're well enough resume life or start the new life because as you know there's three sets of families amongst them so four small children the youngest very small two or three years old uh there are older women one of whom by the way Andrew was reported by Islam Jihad who said they were holding her and also said she died in an Israeli air strike and I think that just gives you a feeling for how much the these um hostages are seen as bargaining chips um and part of a Sops the psychological game that Hamas can play with um with Israel you know part of the war definitely uh and so they will now be taken in to care it's interesting I I heard an interview with and then spoke myself to someone who'd been a child hostage at anbe you remember that 1970 dramatic rescue um of a a plane in in Uganda uh and he said he's never been the same since you know and he wasn't held for so long so there's lots of recovery work ahead uh tonight about to reach an Israeli hospital I think some of the Israeli people I've spoken to here tonight were quite shocked by that Hamas video seeing it as propaganda seeing them presenting themselves as caring putting their arms around uh some of the hostages although I have to say when I looked at some of those hostages they did look pretty frightened yeah I mean and we just want to let our viewers know that that's what they're looking at this is from hamas's militant uh Wing we are showing the images that they have uh provided uh but of course it was on October 7th people will remember that these people in and the hostages released today raging an age from 2 to 85 they were taken hostage 1,200 people were killed on that day on October 7th and now 13 have been uh released 13 Israelis have been released now almost half of the hostages being released today though are taii part of a separate uh deal what can you tell us about them yes you know there's been because they're Tha Nationals um some of them were here working in fact one of them was working as a carer um they were all working I thought all of them were Farm Workers but then one of the people from kibuts near o where many of these rescued the rescued Israelis are from he was there working as a carer for their father and they said they greeted his release with great joy and they hope he can be reunited with his family their father has been killed and this carer was taken hostage and today he's been released so they are workers um most of them agricultural workers some of them carers uh and it was it was separately negotiated originally there was talk of the Thai government and Iran being involved but in the end it seemed from what we've heard uh Egypt is taking credit and saying they were the ones who were responsible for this deal it was a separate track of negotiation alt together and I have to say because I didn't expect it and I know many people here were shocked also it was a great joy um to see an extra 11 people freed today that no one expected to see freed and and what do we know about the Palestinian detainees that were held in Israel who are returning to the West Bank we know that uh many of them are women I've seen a very moving account of someone on Twitter saying it's so great to greet the love of your life so there were 39 women and youths uh and they were being released most of them to the West Bank some of them to Jerusalem that's where they're from none of them are from Gaza so they're not going back to Gaza it's interesting because there were joyfill scenes in Palestinian towns and I must say what really struck me was how many Hamas flags were in that crowd so you know if aim of all of this was um the destruction of Hamas I'm not sure that that's working as an idea it might work as a as a destruction of infrastructure that was Israel's aim uh in in Gaza but you can see that the idea of Hamas and and the release of these Prisoners has led to to um celebrations of Hamas and yeah we're just showing you some of the uh the names of uh those who have uh been released it included a number of women and number of uh those under 18 uh years old we're just showing that on our screen uh right now and so uh Iris before we let you go though we want to just get a sense you're in Tel Aviv just you tell us I mean this this moment you know 57 weeks uh later I mean how would you describe it I would describe it as the one moment of joy release since October the 7th October the 7th was a brutal experience for Israelis uh if you're if you haven't seen the video of what what was shot actually by Hamas themselves with their GoPro cameras then I think you're a lucky person it's indelible memories of horror of torture and horror and I think the impact of that plus then the war plus the hostage taking has been has been very um difficult for Israelis I think they're still in recovery actually and so the joy of this I know it's not all the hostages I know it's only the first lot of the first 50 but this feeling that people are coming home and that they include such small children as well as such old women um I think is a is a moment of likeness and I have to just say if you think about Gaza the thought of the guns falling silent after 49 48 days uh of of the kind of air strikes they've lived through I think that's a wonderful thing for Gaza too"}, "N3A4KUq91B8": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3A4KUq91B8", "video_id": "N3A4KUq91B8", "description": "It is

it's taken place Hamas it's released 13 Israeli and four thigh hostages in exchange for the freedom of another 39 Palestinian prisoners and detainees this is how hamas's armed Wing released the hostages from captivity the hostages were handed over to the Red Cross for safe passage into Israel bye now goodbye the doctor waiting there okay the Red Cross Vehicles carried the second round of released hostages through Egypt's Rafa border crossing and finally the car F the hostages through the south of Israel to camps set up by the Israeli Defense Forces for the rehabilitation of the captives the entire exchange of hostages it was monitored by prime minister benam Netanyahu Netanyahu has been monitoring The Exchange process since yesterday in return the Israeli prison authorities released 13 Palestinian detainees the prisoners were welcomed home in East Jerusalem the most prominent individual released was isra jabis who was convicted of death detonating a gas cylinder in the car at a checkpoint in 2015 she was sentenced to 11 years in prison for wounding a police officer celebrations broke out in several parts of palestine's West Bank to celebrate the release of prisoners from Israeli jails but the second hostage prisoner Exchange took several hours to materialize Hamas delayed the second release yesterday claiming that Israel had failed to comply with the preset terms regarding the entry of relief trucks into Northern Gaza disagreement over the criteria for releasing prisoners also led to the delay Hamas decided to continue the temporary truce only after Egyptians and kares assured that Israel would abide by all of the agreed terms now for more on this we're being joined by Edward p Joseph Mr Joseph is is a senior fellow at John's Hopkins University School of advanced international studies and foreign policy analyst sir thank you so much for joining us on the show you're welcome so as I mentioned the second batch of hostages have been released this of course did not happen with without its share of issues as we know this deal was delayed the second batch the release of the second batch of hostages it was delayed now what's your take on how the truce has proceeded so far well so far this comes at very welcome news to anyone who is concerned about human suffering and that is the suffering of both Palestinian civilians in Gaza and also Israeli families and entire nation of Israel that is uh so concerned and worried about the hostages that were criminally taken by Hamas on October 7th and so this is Comes This is welcome relief to have this release of these hostages one as young as three years old as young as three years old and this comes of course uh thanks in part to President Biden's personal intervention here it shows how concerned the president of the United States is President Biden spoke with the Amir of uh Qatar this morning to uh ensure that the uh prepared and arranged uh hostage release the exchange the release of uh Palestinian prisoners and the release of the Israeli hostages criminally seized abducted uh there um from Israel on October 7th would proceed and indeed it did and this is uh give some momentum and some hope that there will be a further truce and that is calm for Palestinian civilians uh increased humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians and of course further release of Israeli hostages and Internationals that have nothing to do with this conflict including those Thai civilians who were released please uh right sir absolutely that being said despite there being some concrete progress in this war on ground uproar and protests have continued we've seen there's a lot of agitation still what is your assessment of how things will proceed going forward Israel as we know has made it clear that this is not the end of the war and that the war will continue so it's fair to say that their hunt for Hamas will continue so what's your assess of how things will go forward well I would say that the uh as you put it the hunt for Hamas uh has International backing this has uh the backing of President Biden who is not stated that Israel has to agree to a a ceasefire some type of agreed prolonged uh uh halt to the military operation against Hamas President Biden of course wants Israel to focus on Hamas and to do take maximum efforts to minimize uh the Palestinian civilian casualties that's what President Biden wants to see but there's there's no pressure even uh here from uh within President Biden's own party you have Bernie Sanders who has no hesitation to call Hamas a terrorist organization he wants he uh representing the the the progressive left wing of the democratic party calls on Israel to stop indiscriminate bombardment but even Bernie Sanders this is this is the left-wing Progressive leader in the United States does not call for Israel to to Halt the military campaign against Hamas so and Israel retains a lot of support within the European Union uh also with from Canada so there the the operation uh to oust Hamas uh not to um inflict pain on Palestinian civilians which of course who have suffered tremendously in this 50-day old conflict but the the operation uh to go after Hamas remains in place while this uh humanitarian pause and these exchange of uh of hostages and the release of Palestinian prisoners continues please right sir also I'll just let my viewers know that these are the live visuals that were getting from the shba medical center in t Aviv these are the live visuals that are coming in at this point of course we're tracking the developments on the truce very closely here now sir also we've seen that mediation efforts by Egypt and K have continued they are in fact hoping for an extension to this 4-day TR uh truce so do you think an extension of this truce is in the offing well that is of course the big question um hoping of course for uh the the welfare of everyone concerned including Palestinian civilians in Gaza that the the next two days of the agreed 4-day humanitarian pause will continue as planned with the exchanges as planned uh the question of course is what happens then on the fifth day uh now the terms of the agreement that uh negotiated with the assistance of Qatar and Egypt have not been made public but it has been reported uh several times that Israel has agreed to extend the pause one day for each additional 10 Israeli hostages who've been released and let me add here quickly there's been some attempt to try to equate the Israeli hostages criminally seized some including a now 10-month-old baby taken by Hamas an Israeli baby a Jewish baby taken by Hamas among the hostages criminally SE there's been some effort to equate this with the Palestinian civilians and I would just read here from the Secretary General of amnesty International who who writes this is a quote from Agnes kard Secretary General of Amnesty International in addition to horrific summary killings of civilians which took place in several locations across Southern Israel by Hamas at least at this time she was writing 150 hostages have been taken into Gaza including some children and foreign Nationals the this is she writes Secretary General of Amnesty International the Abduction of civilians is prohibited by international law and hostage taking is War crime again that's the head of Amnesty International so there's no equivalence here there's no equivalence between Palestinian uh who Palestinians who have been arrested and received a court proceeding and imprisoned for for example attempted terrorism and a three-year-old or even a 9-month-old baby seized by Hamas uh in its uh uh criminal and horrific operation on October 7th Please Mr joose thank you so much for joining us on the show with your insights and perspective on this you're welcome that was Mr Edward p Joseph joining us on the broadcast we are of course tracking all the developments that are coming in from the Israel Hamas War Front where there has a 4day truce is in effect these are the live visuals that we're getting from the Shabba Medical Center in Tel Aviv as you know of course the second batch of hostages have been

video and we're not going to give the names of the three individuals who were part of this message but we have seen and heard and translated what they had to say so let us look at some of the details of what is a distressing uh video to emerge we're joined by our diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams Paul what can you tell us about this video it's really hard to watch three women we have confirmed their identities but we are not as you say going to name them at the moment they are sitting in a white tiled room on chairs dressed rather as the hostages were the other day in what appeared to be Palestinian costumes and one of them speaks and she speaks with real Fury and she addresses her remarks to Benjamin Netanyahu who Israel's prime minister she says that they have been in captivity for 23 days that suggests to me that maybe this video was recorded yesterday she also refers to a press conference that the families of the hostages had given the previous day that we think was two days ago in which she says we know there was supposed to be a ceasefire you were supposed to let us all go now yes there was a press conference and yes clearly there's a lot of talk about ceasefires but nothing from the Israeli side nothing from prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to suggest that such a deal had actually been struck so that to my way of thinking suggests that that's what they've been told happened they probably don't have any access independent access to information they are entirely dependent on what their Hamas captors are telling them they appear to be healthy they do not appear to have been abused or injured but the the woman who speaks is extremely emotional and she becomes almost uncontrollably emotional at the end she says that the Army was not there to protect them on the 7th of October no one arrived no one guarded us and we are innocent civilians she also says addressing her remarks to Benjamin Netanyahu isn't in isn't it enough to slaughter everyone not enough Israeli civilians killed and she just ends her remarks by saying let us go back to our families now now now it's really hard to watch it's very distressing first of all for the families uh when we're hoping they have been told about this in as careful a way as possible it would at least give them a sign that their loved ones are alive um and as you say that they look healthy but it's also deeply deeply distressing and the Israeli view on these videos and what Hamas is doing with the hostages prime minister Netanyahu has called it psychological terrorism using them to pursue their War aims yes it's hard to dispute a characterization like that this is not a video recorded you know out of free will this is a a video recorded by three women who have been held for 23 days in conditions that we can only guess at we do have a little insight courtesy of the other hostages who were released who said they were being generally well treated once they got to the side not on the way not on the way that Journey from the places where they were taken to the places where they were held was clearly extremely traumatic and everything that has happened to them for the last 3 weeks has been utterly traumatic so you have to obviously take that into account when you read these words these are the words they may well reflect some of the trauma and the anger that they themselves feel feel but maybe they also reflect some of the things that they have been asked to say we just don't know but the impact of this is going to be huge it is going to add to the pressure on Mr Netanyahu to do more to get hostages out it is going to cause yet another wave of trauma in this country where wave upon wave of trauma has already been crashing on on the population you know this this story has the has the ability to do do that to us every few days and this is just going to add to that and you know there you have three three women begging begging their government to bring them home yes just deepening the trauma of so many and it's not just the families and loved ones with the hostages is there's so many in this country who themselves are torn about what has been happening Benjamin Netanyahu met some of the families he reassured them reassured the nation that Israel has two priorities he said destroying Hamas and bringing the hostages home and his view was that this this intensifying war the ground operations would help he said the only way to bring the hostages home is not that ceasefire that the women were no doubt told to say in that video given as you say the so little knowledge but by intensifying the pressure and indeed the defense minister you have Galant made exactly the same point that is the way to force Hamas into some kind of deal it was interesting when Mr Netanyahu spoke at that press conference two days ago and he did he listed those two priorities and it was in that order destroying Hamas and bringing the hostages home clearly his main priority still as far as we can make out is to destroy Hamas the you know many many people in this country are asking how can you achieve both of those is that even remotely possible and is it more likely that the more military pressure you bring to bear the more you send troops into those uh congested areas where the hostages might be being held the more air strikes are conducted over Gaza the more likely it is that actually hostages will come to harm and indeed another statement from H Hamas was this morning in response to the latest signs of the Israelis moving in on the ground was precisely that the more you do this the more you're likely to harm hostages so this is an awful awful psychological game which the Caps are playing and they are hoping still with so many cards in their hands more than 200 people that somehow this is going to have an an impact on the Israeli government so far we have seen no sign of that is there something going on behind the scenes maybe we know that many many actors including the Gulf State of Qatar are trying very very hard to orchestrate a deal in which there could be a release of hostages maybe in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails but at the moment we have no sign that any of that is is imminent this is just going to add to the the pressure and the Despair and once again the trauma surrounding all of those questions yes and that Friday night when Israel expanded its ground operations it came suddenly uh a diplomat briefed on the negotiations through the Gulf State of katar uh Express regrets saying we were so close that but said there were still some issues in dispute and of course we know those are very big issues one of them most of all that ceasefire that the women in the video today talked about and Paul just before we came on air there were reports swirling again that even now even though there had been a fear that these talks would stop that there are really crucial discour discussions going on now as we speak in Qatar focusing we believe just on the civilians yes I I think there are conversations going on everywhere there was even uh talk of Hamas officials being in Cairo the Egyptian Capital you know again part of this complex web of negotiations and discussions which continues all the time and me it may sound almost uh bizarre to to the to the audience to think that a war could be raging and conversations could still be having indirectly between the the Waring parties about the possible exchange of prisoners but these things do happen even in the midst of of wars and so we couldn't we can't exclude the fact that something of that kind may still emerge and it may be that the Hamas people who are holding those women maybe they thought that such a thing was imminent uh you know the truth of these negotiations is being held by so few people and it's only when the deal is done that anyone gets to know I suppose the one glimmer of hope that the families can hold on to is the general view that these hostages and they're being held by Hamas also Islamic Jihad and there were reports that they were in the hands of of gazin who just went and grabbed people is that they only matter if they're alive yes they want to keep them alive they want these bargaining chips as terrible as it is to say to say that and Paul you mentioned the details of it was a a a white tiled room yeah many eyes will be on these these videos most of all their families to see for signs that of distress of the health had they lost weight how did they look did they look stressed and the women had different Expressions without going into more details but was this in if it was as widely believed in one of those deep deep tunnels it was very well pointed if you can use that word it it didn't look like cave it wasn't a cave it didn't look like the kind of tunnels that we have seen evidence of in the past it didn't look it didn't look dank it didn't look Sandy it looked clean tiled white uh so I'm sure many many eyes will be pouring over that trying to see any signs there were there were no obvious signs really about the kind of place they were being held gazer is a is a small place as you know a very small place but it's also very gested place and there are many many places where you could hide civilians and we don't know you're right we don't know who is holding who I suspect that by now Hamas being the major uh group in Gaza that if anyone if anyone has was freelancing on this hostage taking probably the hostages have been gathered and maybe sort of held centrally but you know we just don't know um and could this be the Prelude to to to any more hostage releases again it's just impossible to know but it is also just impossible to ignore so agonizing so so agonizing one of the many very tragic human dimensions of this very very ugly intensifying War Paul Adams I know you'll get more information for us on this and all the other developing stories today thank you very much for joining us on BBC News and to confirm again if you've just joined us in the last hour aasa's military Wing has released another video a hostage video on it telegram Channel we are not broadcasting the video it is not BBC policy to usually broadcast the video we're not giving the identities but we've been discussing what the three women one of the women who spokes had to say we'll continue to try to get more details not just about this video but the impact on the families on Israelis and most of all on those intense and highly sensitive negotiations to bring the hostages home let's take a look at other the other top stories this hour Israel says it has expanded its ground and air operation"}, "AQAFb-ftfJ8": {"url":

we are waiting to hear and see to take the hostages to uh the hospitals where they're going to be treated and eventually meet with their families so this moment right now when we're speaking we're talking about just moments ago the hostages those first 13 hostages uh from within uh which we understand and has been confirmed it's women children some of the children perhaps with their own mothers as they were not going to be separated other than the 13 hostages there's already been 12 Thai hostages who were also captured on October 7th their negotiation was not part of the negotiation uh between Israel and Hamas with the US Qatar and Egypt as intermediaries they were negotiated separately but according to the Thai prime minister they're already in Israel uh We've also been hearing reports that among the 13 hostages that have just been reled least uh none seem to be in critical condition of course we there's a lot of reporting that we need to corroborate as we go but from the images that are coming uh of these trucks getting across the border into Egypt across the Rafa Crossing uh and before they get here it seems like some uh were sitting up uh perhaps I can't tell from the images because it's small waving um but we're going to wait here for news of how many are getting across that Raffa Crossing into Egypt and exactly when we can expect them here in this base that will be the moment of course Omar once they cross from Egypt into Israel the moment that after these 48 days in captivity that nightmare comes to an end for just these 13 and some of their family members who survived and they get home but from here on it's a long road to recovery and of course keep in mind that there are more than 200 hostages uh that still need to get home and and let me bring Robert in here I mean there's there's the planning of this and the performance of this Robert um break this down for us what more are we learning about the process did did is everything going as we expected it's going yes it's going smoothly I mean this was supposed to happen at 4 pm. um local time and which is about 9:00 am uh eastern time and sure enough the 13 were released into the hands of the Red Cross and now uh it's about an hour later uh two hours later and uh they've crossed the border uh into into Egypt so it's a very dramatic moment and um it seems to be unfolding his plan by the way this began with a ceasefire this morning at 7 AM local time the ceasefire held and so we've now seen this first batch uh released uh which of course is just the beginning of this 4-day process 4-day paus and fighting in which we're going to see maybe 12 13 Israeli hostages released each day and uh now once the once the Israelis get back to um to Israel and in the hands of the Israelis they are supposed to release 39 Palestinian prisoners which would include women and teenagers Robert let me follow up real quick how delicate was this ceasefire agreement we all hear people talking about it but can you give us a sense of how razor thin this was because we heard reports of 10 minutes before it was supposed to you know the ceasefires was going to start that there was still fighting you know that that's how the ceas fires always are there's a lot of fighting up until the end and sometimes the ceasefires don't hold you know in the 50-day war back in uh 2014 there were a lot of ceasefires until the final one actually held and so there was a lot of there's a lot of tension an anticipation leading up to whether or not this ceasefire would would hold but really it's held and even on the northern border where there's been fighting between Israel and Hezbollah that's even been quiet so uh it's going it's going very well so far and Lilia let me go to you there at at the air base you told us about the 12 Tha hostages uh who were also released um but for the Israeli hostages are we learning names yet I know that families were were alerted but is everything still kind of Under Wraps everything is under wraps I've talked to Advocates who are assisting volunteering uh basically representing the family because there's so much media interest and what they're telling me is that up until the moment of the release family members were not that they're forbidden but were speaking and that they have kind of decided as a group that once uh the first hostages are released for sure the families of those hostages released are going to stay tight lipped focus on coming together on the needs of these hostages and won't be speaking for several days uh of course there are so many hostages and so many family members uh that certainly that rule would it's not something that would apply to all of the families and all of the hostages but for now we don't know exactly who has been released that said we are seeing some images of those trucks and perhaps some people might be able to identify who is in those trucks we don't know what kind of images the IDF might release in the coming hours but what I can tell you is that all of Israel is stuck to their television sets right now in expectation um the families of the hostages that were released were told already yesterday uh once the uh Israeli government received the list of who would be released today they were told that their loved ones other their family members are going to be released today once that release happens now today I believe that around 400 p.m. once the hostages were given from Hamas to the Red Cross the next list tomorrow's list is supposed to be released to the Israeli government we don't know where that stands at this time so we don't know who was released yet or who will be but certainly in the next several hours depending on what kinds of images and messaging comes from the government and uh the IDF we might very well learn that one thing I'll tell you is there's a great deal of expectation of course audience in the US people are asking I've seen it on social media about Abigail thatd three-year-old American hostages whose both parents were killed um we don't know if she was released today but it doesn't seem that that is the case uh from much of our reporting that said there is three more days to come in the ceasefire of exchanges of hostages and uh potentially more if Hamas decides to turn 10 more hostages uh that would signify an extra day and besides this of course MTS TB is uh in the West Bank he has been covering the release of the Palestinians who are being held prisoner in Israeli prisons and so those are also women and children um there is a great deal of expectation there people are being told that they can't celebrate uh so MTS was is going to continue on that reporting as he is in the West Bank as he is you know Gathering all of that information and and talking to families of people who are being detained this is the hostages being turned to uh from Hamas to Israel and of course there are also women and children who were in detention in Israeli prisons that are being uh released into Palestinian territories last question here uh two-parter here for Robert um what kind of medical attention are are we expecting the Israeli hostages to have available to them uh for what they need and also on on on the Palestinians who were released do we I know names on both sides are are under wraps do we have names from either side no I I not publicly though the families have been informed um but basically what's going to happen is they're going to be taken to an Israeli army base uh nearby and then from there they're going to be the the Israeli hostages are going to be moved to various hospitals where they're going to meet up with their families and also get medical evaluation and see how they're doing physically uh first of all and then of course psychologically um they're going to get that kind of help from psychologists and social workers because obviously they've been through a terrible ordeal Robert and Lilia this is a very fluid situation but thank you very much uh for some insight and Reporting thank you very much thank you CBS News White House reporter Willie James Inman is traveling with President Biden he joins us now from nant Tucket Willie what is the White House saying after this early news that we're getting about the hostage release well Omar so far there's been new response from the White House we in fact reached out to them we haven't gotten a response quite yet but yesterday uh the Press pool caught up with President Biden he didn't say much about the hostages being released but he did say essentially that he was hopeful uh that this would indeed go forward and we of course are looking uh for those three Americans two women and Abigail that young toddler as Lilia mentioned to be released they're not in this first batch of hostages being released by Hamas uh but still nonetheless uh we anticipate we could potentially see the president today and we'll certainly ask him for response about this these first hostages being released by Hamas and and you kind of let in my second question there you mentioned Abigail and the Americans are not in that first round but is there any timetable that you're hearing that that the White House is aware of when the Americans may be released well officials are are certainly hopeful that they'll be in that first 50 of the hostages being released we spoke with John Kirby an NFC spokesperson just the other day and that's in fact what he mentioned he Supple that those two women in Abigail a young toddler whose family was murdered essentially in that attack in early October will be released in this that first of 50 or so hostages and the White House has been really working the phon the president himself he's been on the phone with leaders uh trying to make sure that this plan goes forward and that's what the White House is focusing on we're told on the implementation of this deal and that indeed seems to be what's playing out right now on our screens and well you get a sense of how intense this is listen this is a holiday weekend here but on something like this everybody's got to be working if that is their job there for that how intense is the Biden Administration getting involved cuz we hear you know Qatar Egypt Israel Hamas what point and how intense is the US involved in all of this well officials following president officials with the president will tell you that he's been working the phones he spoke with the leaders of Israel Egypt and Qatar just the other day when this after this deal it came through and that indeed what is what we can potentially expect from the president moving forward uh the implementation of this plan we know that he has been heavily involved in fact traveling to Israel after this attack took place and you've seen uh White House officials everyone from Secretary of State Anthony blinkin travel to the region to help get this deal through and the qaris they were very pivotal in negotiating helping to negotiate between Hamas and Israel the United States being involved as well in White House officials continue to stress that their focus their priority is not only the implementation of this deal but also getting those hostages home and that's indeed what the president expressed yesterday when we briefly caught up with him Omar Willie Inman with the president in Nantucket thank you very much and we'll continue to monitor the story and bring you updates as we get them for now a quick break you're streaming CBS [Music] News"}, "PyGiXTGq_kU": {"url":

moments of Peace families on both the sides of the war are now reuniting with their lost loved ones have a look at these visuals this is where it all began this is how Hamas handed over Israeli hostages to the Red Cross most of the hostages were aged and the youngest was a 2-year-old child the hostage swap was two-way the hostages released on Friday from Gaza included 13 Israelis 10 thi and one Filipino citizen K who is mediating the truth also said said that he is hopeful that the American hostages will also be released and at least four Americans while women and children will be released soon meanwhile Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reacted to the development last night and welcomed the hostages back into the country take a [Music] listen a crowd of overjoyed Israelis welcomed children and women who were held hostage by Hamas and Gaza for 49 days since the war broke out on October 7th the hostages were transported by helicopters to the hospital in central Israel the hostages upon entry into Israel were subjected to a thorough medical examination and hostages were declared to be healthy and safe about half an hour ago I was thrilled to be the one to receive four children three mothers and a grandmother to the best and most Caring Hands here at Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel their physical condition is good and they're currently undergoing medical and emotional assessment by the medical and psychological team here at schneiders we designated a special area that is very private and there is also a team from from our neighbor bingson hospital that is assisting Us in taking care of the women another five women who were hassed as hostages were transported aboard a chopper to the medical center in t aiv meanwhile Palestinians are also rejoicing the return of 39 prisoners held in Israeli jails massive crowd gathered and cheered as prisoners arrived in a town outside west bangs ramala the release of the 39 prisoners is a part of the latest truce deal between Israel and the Hamas [Laughter] militants Essential Air has also begun to flow into the Gaza Strip after the truce came into effect on Friday trucks loaded with humanitarian Aid entered Gaza through the Rafa border 137 trucks of goods have it they have been offloaded in Gaza making it the biggest Convoy received since October 7th up next Israel has also received a list of hostages set to be freed today by Hamas and this will Mark the second day of the planned for day truce between the Waring sides and for more on this our correspondent Susan Tani sends this report from New York take a look speaking from nanta Massachusetts where the president is spending Thanksgiving weekend he said that Americans have even more to be thankful for this Thanksgiving with the news of the release of some 24 hostages from Hamas captivity while no Americans were among those released on Friday it had been earlier reported that three Americans may have been part of the initial release of hostages nonetheless President Biden admitted that he does not know when Hamas would free us hostages as whether or not this truce or ceasefire would be extended in order to release more hostages the president said quote unquote the chances are real President Biden also stressed that this is only a start acknowledging that it has so far gone well this truce between Israel and Hamas however with this pause and fighting there is also this air of uncertainty on whether or not the deal could fall through any day there's also concern on the US part regarding the attack on US troops and service members across the Middle East for now no us troop or service member has been killed however if that changes then America's response will be detrimental and as for now there are no good options Susan Tani reporting from New York for weon world is one and more on this we're now being joined by Glenn call Mr Carl is a former National Intelligence officer from the CIA and National Security and foreign experts welcome to the broadcast Mr Carl thank you all right Mr Carl now just a short file ago US President Joe Biden has said that the chances of an of an extension of the ongoing truths were real what is your assessment what are the chances of the Curren Seas fire extending because we heard Israeli Prime Minister Nathan yahu also asserting on how they committed in achieving all the goals of the war and bringing back all the hostages back to Israel well it seems that ceasefire I'm confident a ceasefire is an advantage for both parties uh not only because of the exchange of prisoners which is a good thing for the Palestinians and Hamas and a good thing for the Israelis and the Netanyahu government but also because it gives in particular Hamas a chance to resupply reorganize and plan for the Israelis also but since Hamas is uh the weaker party and uh under attack at this time uh I think the ceasefire probably does help Hamas uh of course the Israelis will be watching as this uh plays out but I can see the ceasefire extending for um a day or two uh we've heard that the Israelis have offered to extend the ceasefire uh 24 hours for each 10 hostages that released and uh so I think the prospects are are strong that that will probably happen for another day or two anyway in addition to what's already agreed right Mr K you speak of how the ceasefire could be extended beyond the 4 days but uh nathany has clearly lamented that the war is not over at this moment do you think Israel will be able to strike a balance between hostage release and eliminating Hamas which is its ultimate aim well if if as you have just framed it uh in those terms I think the answer is yes I think that they will they the Israelis probably will continue a ceasefire or be willing to do it to extend it for more hostages and that doesn't change at all their plans to uh or their objective of eliminating Hamas now whether Israel can achieve that has always been a much larger question and U that's a challenge at best Mr call while the truce is in effect we've seen uh the success in day one of the truce uh the Israeli military has warn people against returning to Northern Gaza clearly outlining how the war is not over and apart from that an IDF spokesperson also said that they intend to demolish many tunnels after the ceasefire uh completes I'm sure all of that is true and we've also heard reports I'm sure you have of uh Palestinians who uh tried to return to the northern half of Gaza and apparently were fired upon uh and also who were subjected to tear gas to disperse them I think or keep them from coming north uh Israel will continue to try to blow up the tunnels I I think that objective Israel probably uh can have a large uh measure of success in in achieving but blowing up tunnels is not the same thing as destroying Hamas as a coherent uh organization right Mr C just a short while ago US President Joe Biden held a press conference and said that uh putting conditions on military aid is a worthwhile thought how do you gauge that state M by Biden and why has a statement come now after the US has already given $14.3 billion in Aid to Israel well Biden is is caught on the horns of a dilemma for that matter everyone involved or touched by this uh fighting is in on the horns of a dilemma too uh Biden has uh as we all know strongly at the at the very least we could say strongly um expressed or extended the support of the United States to netanyahu's government uh as it tries to eliminate Hamas but at the same time progressively Biden's Administration has been trying to uh keep the Israelis from uh killing uh Palestinian civilians probably an impossible task if they're attacking in Gaza uh and is trying Biden's Administration to uh pressure progressively it appears the Netanyahu government to um realize I think that the costs uh of its current uh military campaign are growing probably faster than the rewards that Israel is achieving uh by killing more Hamas Fighters but it's a an unsatisfactory Balancing Act for much of the Muslim world and for that matter for for uh many other people and that's the Dilemma Biden is trying to uh to uh yes solve how to pressure pal uh Israel while supporting Israel right Mr car there are also growing calls around the world for a permanent ceasefire how do you think that the International Community especially countries like the US and Qatar which have clearly played a major role of mediation how are they going to use their weight that they have in this maybe to change Israeli Minds for a permanent ceasefire like we've been talking about how Israel how Nathan is adamant uh when he says that the war is not over I think probably without stating it publicly uh cutter even uh would agree with uh netanyahu's statement there and and the US probably too uh most Muslim governments are not uh very uh favorably disposed toward Hamas and although uh they strongly uh support the Palestinian people and uh oppose Israel's uh seemingly um uncontrolled or or poorly controlled uh attacks which are causing so much Palestinian uh death uh it's a bit early it seems to me in the view of most governments frankly uh that's not the populations but most governments for a ceasefire because Hamas remains uh a as I said before a coherent entity and quite capable of continuing to uh control Gaza and to attack Israel and Hamas doesn't have a lot of friends other than in tan um and progressively it seems in Moscow um Mr car what would you say Do you think that the ID of mission in Gaza has been a success so far for Israel yes yeah uh that's a difficult question I think the short answer is no um Israel had to respond after uh 1300 massacred people uh but it didn't necessarily have to respond for 6 weeks and killing uh many thousands of Palestinians and uh I and many others before Israel went into Gaza with the Army uh were very doubtful that a conventional military campaign could uh eliminate uh Hamas functionally eliminate Hamas without causing so much suffering of the Palestinians that the uh harm to Israel uh and and the instability and dangers for the entire region and world would not outweigh the uh supposed benefit that Israel is trying to achieve right Mr Carl thank you so much for joining us here on weon and sharing insights

That's   the latest  that  we have  right now.  I'm going to   pull  up  a number  of  the  shots that  we  have. This   is  a shot  right now outside  of  the prison. one of  the  prisons where again the  Palestinian prisoners are  expected  to  be  released.  sometime  later today.  this   all coming  as  temporary  truce.  has raised  some   hopes eventually. winding  down that conflict, which is   flattened vast  swathes of   Gaza  fueling a surge of   violence  in  the occupied   West  Bank  as well.  and  stirred fears of  wire. wider  conflagration.  across the   Middle East Israel  have  our  has said  that   it's determined to  resume.  its massive offensive.  once   the ceasefire deal. ends.  Take  a live look now at  the  offer prison. This  is  where  those 39. Palestinian  prisoners are expected  to   be  released. And a part of  that  exchange  we   know today  of  course,  though. an  additional. 25.  both  pow Israeli.  and tie.   Nationals also  being a  released as part  of  this   deal. on  Friday, of  course   in  the morning There was  some  quiet after weeks of   fighting  in Gaza.  a very   heavy.  bombardment and at   artillery fire  was a daily.   over the  past  seven weeks  as  well  as  street   fighting  and ground  troops.  advancing.  through  neighborhoods in  the North.   The last  report  of  air  raid  sirens  and Israeli  towns near  that  territory.   came  shortly after the truce  took  effect. We're also   learning  that  about.  four   tankers with  fuel  and  for with  cooking gas also   entered Gaza  Strip.  from   Egypt.  according to  Israel.  Israel says it  will  allow  the delivery  of   130 thousand liters or  about  35,000  gallons of  fuel   thirty four thousand gallons   of  fuel. per day.  during   that  true  still only  a  part. and a small portion of   gaza's  estimated daily.   needs for more  than  1  million liters  that they  need. according to  the  United Nations  eight  agencies  they're pushing  back against  the claim that   fuel  deliveries  were   closely.  supervised  and  urgently  need  to  avert a  humanitarian. catastrophe.   this  as  of  course. there's  been  concerned by  Israeli  officials to  actually   release a fuel  to  that   area. Let's go  ahead  and take  a live look at   one of  the hospitals that   hostages  are expected  to   be  brought to  as  I this   historic. and important.  A  situation is  happening right  now this  hostage release as   the Hamas.  terrorist group.   that  militant  group is   releasing.  25   five hostages.  13  Israelis   and 12  Thai  Nationals.   Most of them  women.   and children. We  are taking   a live  look  through.   a number  of  feeds coming   into us from  the Israeli.   government  right now.   That's  what  those videos   are.  One of  the  hospital's right. there.  You  can see that  helipad.  is   where those those hostages   are expected to be   brought as  they  need  to.  be  taken care  of.  medically.  once  they   arrived to  get their  checkups  following.  a very   intense seven weeks being  held  captive by  Hamas.   We're also  know  that  even   though  Israel  had warned   that  it  would block.  any  attempts  to  continue  a  photo of fighting there.   apparently  two people   had been  shot  by  Israeli  troops  and another 11.  wounded according to  an   associated.

particular have been taken after they have been freed by Hamas or other militants and then they get taken over to this hospital where they are not only assessed by medical Physicians and psychologists but where some of the most moving reunions we have witnessed in the past 3 days take place children who haven't seen their parents parents who haven't seen their children those hugs that joy that burst of emotion takes place at that hospital it's also where so many people who haven't seen daylight for 50 days are going to get re acclimated to what it means to be a free person after 50 days of being held hostage now all of this is happening because we are in day three of a 4-day temporary truce between Hamas and Israel we know that 17 Israelis and foreign Nationals have already been free today some of them across the Rafa border crossing but most of the Israelis actually made their way directly into Israeli soil by going through Northern Gaza something we hadn't seen previously we also know that Palestinians are going to be released today as part of this deal and we're going to go to a reporter on the ground on this story in just a moment but in the meantime preparations to release more of those Palestinian detainees as I mentioned is also advancing now that's an Israeli military prison in the West Bank where another 39 are expected to be released at any moment the way this deal works is that once the Israeli hostages or the foreign Nationals are freed that's when Israel frees the Palestinian detain that's the scene we've seen in the past two days they'll be taken to a checkpoint and once those ref those hostages are out the Palestinians get freed so far 78 Palestinians have already found their freedom let's turn to CBC News senior International correspondent Margaret Evans who's on the ground in Jerusalem Margaret what more can you tell us about today's exchange between the hostages and the detainees well as you were saying Natasha there are quite a few children in this latest release at least eight one of them is just four years old she was three when she was taken captive she was orphaned by the Hamas militants who launched those attacks on October 7th there was also the release of a woman named Hagar and her three children with a Canadian C connection Hager broich her husband avihai is one of the main um family members credited with getting the hostage movement underway the pressure on the Israeli government to keep the return of the hostages home uh to as the as the priority of this war he set up a camp outside the Israeli Ministry of Defense in Tel Aviv with a chair and his dog waiting he said finding some way to keep his hope alive that he would see his three children and their mother returned home to him it turned into a huge Mo movement and tonight his kids are on that list the Canadian connection is his brother Aaron who lives in Toronto who hosted one of his nieces at summer camp there in Ontario this summer he's here in Israel he came back to support his brother and he spoke earlier with my colleague Rosemary have a little listen to what he had to say I have to point out that this was before they knew for sure or that they revealed for sure that his family members were on the list I'll just hug them uh you know just just hug them uh I think that that's as far as I'm thinking right now um yeah I yeah that's that's all I can think about I think seeing my brother with them uh I think for us it will also be you know time to let our guard down it gives you just a small sense of how emotional heart-wrenching excruciating these days are the families for the hostages wondering whether they'll come back or not the other thing to mention that's happening tonight of course is the second part of this exchange which is Palestinians held in Israeli jails 39 women minors teenagers being released this evening we understand many of them to occupied East Jerusalem that's taking place as well tonight um with uh some caveats we understand um Israelis pressuring the families of Palestinians not to show any overt signs of Celebration many Palestinians would say there's very little to celebrate these days given the war in Gaza to to begin with but certainly these reunions between uh Palestinians waiting to see their loved ones return from jails are an important part of what's Happening Here Tonight Mark you referenced the the critical situation in Gaza right now can we talk about the humanitarian crisis there how that's being managed right well there as a part of this truce this 4-day pause we're seeing we're supposed to see and have been seeing a a big increase in the number of Aid trucks being allowed into the Gaza Strip not just uh food medicine humanitarian supplies as we've seen in the past but also fuel fuel uh diesel fuel so that trucks can move about but also cooking fuel there are well over 1 million gazin displaced by this conflict more than a million are being hosted we're told by un agencies in schools and place places like that but living rough in camps uh the Palestinian authori is running the Hamas authori is running the Gaza Strip say that the death toll is now over 14,000 in Gaza so it gives you a sense of just how desperate things are there um with the pause that's taking place there has been Aid distributed we're told by Egypt that some uh Aid has actually reached the north there were complaints about it not getting up to the north of course Israeli troops are still in place in Northern Gaza and today we saw images of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visiting some of those troops those soldiers still in place in Northern Gaza while his pause continues he's pledging to continue this war until Hamas is removed from Power until Hamas has no longer any ability to strike against uh Israel and this comes of course one day ahead of the end of the 4-day truth so one more day that in which uh Israelis might see more hostages released Palestinians more Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails a hard time for them people wondering who's going to be on the list but of course there's also a lot of speculation about whether or not there can be a way to see this truce extended we're hearing some reports that Hamas is looking to extend that truce and in recent days we've heard some talk from various Hamas spokespeople saying that there may be more hostages yet unidentified because of course the Hamas militants the armed brigades in particular were responsible for those crossborder attacks but there are other Palestinian factions in Gaza the Islamic Jihad and some other groups potentially operating individually according to analysts who may may or may not have taken hostages as well it could be a bargaining chip it could be reality but it's it's you know the fact that it's kind of coming to the surface just now points to the end of this truce coming and the pressure that's going that we're going to see is people try to figure out whether it's going to extend or whether this war is going to go back to the ferocity we've seen up to this point CBC News senior International correspondent Margaret Evans in Jerusalem thank you Margaret now among the hostages free today a four-year-old girl with dual us and Israeli citizenships US President Joe Biden spoke about her release and his hopes for extending the ceasefire our Katie Simpson is following that story for us from Washington Katie what did Biden say about this latest exchange the US president and his senior officials have been a significant part of these negotiations and Joe Biden says with every reunion with every happy tear that's shed he says it's a sign mind that this fragile deal and these talks are working and he wants to build on it for weeks both publicly and privately Biden has acknowledged the US has pushed Israel to pause its bombardment of Gaza in the hopes it would create the space to facilitate the release of hostages and to get some badly needed humanitarian Aid into Gaza now the language he's used and the positions he's taken have not satisfied his critics and I'll talk about that in just a moment uh but not long after this latest Exchange took place which included the release of a 4-year-old dual citizen American uh girl Biden was asked about whether he'd like this pause and fighting to continue I would like to see us move to a point where we were able to uh well let me put it this way I'd like to see the pause go on as long as prisoners kept coming out the Biden Administration has stopped short of calling for a ceasefire they would argue it they argue it would give Hamas an advantage they say it would allow Hamas to regroup refocus and possibly pose even more of a threat to Israel if Biden is pushing so much and hoping so much for a continued ceasefire continued truce is there a chance that the Biden administration's support for Israel May shift well the word ceasefire Biden has not called for that and there's been intense pressure on Joe Biden uh to take that next step now that is one aspect of uh of the domestic pressure that Joe Biden is facing a senior us official uh would not rule out whether the us is going to shift its support for Israel to put conditions on that support Jake Sullivan who is the US National Security adviser was repeatedly asked whether Biden would impose conditions on Israel in order to provide that continued support and he didn't rule it out only pointing to the comments made by Biden on Friday uh when asked President Biden described it as a worthwhile thought Biden is badly losing support mostly a young among young and Progressive of Voters based on his handling of this conflict uh what we've seen at rallies and what we've heard from some of these voters is they say they're frustrated the White House is not called for a ceasefire specifically and that their position is Israel's response is unacceptable pointing to the deaths and destructions in Gaza that is according to many of these voters who are expressing their frustration about the Biden Administration if the US were to publicly impose conditions on continued support that would be a definite shift"}, "zV6KNuDZDW8": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zV6KNuDZDW8", "video_id": "zV6KNuDZDW8", "description": "A third round of hostages, including 4-year-old American Abigail Edan, have

AND TODAY AS ERIN MENTIONED ON THE THIRD RELEASE WE ARE SEEING ONE AMERICAN CITIZEN RELEASED AS PART OF THIS DEAL. BUT AS YOU MENTIONED, MANY MORE AMERICANS BEING HELD HOSTAGE, AND SULLIVAN THIS MORNING ON THE SUNDAY SHOWS SAID AT THIS POINT THEY STILL DO NOT KNOW THE CONDITION AND WHEREABOUTS OF ALL OF THOSE HOSTAGES, KATE. >> YEAH, AND AS WE KNOW WE HAVE ONE MORE DAY OF CEASEFIRE THAT WE KNOW OF RIGHT NOW, IT COULD BE EXTENDED.

"uploader": "Channel 4 News", "transcript": "Jackie we first started to get some indication that something was a miss here when Hamas said first of all in the afternoon that the exchange of hostages was actually taking place in Gaza but then soon after that rode back and said that there was a a delay in response Israel said that if there wasn't a hostage release by midnight the offensive would resume in Gaza so what is going on here it's not clear all we're going on is statements from both sides Hamas have said that the delay is down to a dispute over the number of humanitarian trucks getting into Gaza there's they say there's fewer being allowed in than was in the original deal they're also saying it's a dispute over the age of the Palestinian Dees that qualify for release Israel on their part are saying that himas are moving the goalpost they're saying this is psychological warfare designed to inflict pain on the family there is a hope a Qatari official flew into Israel today the qataris are the intermediate iies here there is a hope that the sort of physical presence of the guaris on the ground will help but we don't yet know I guess there was perhaps a sense of hope built up after how smoothly things went yesterday and let's hope that that is not a false hope Ohad M hasn't seen his father for 49 days Ohad brother greets his mother and grandmother also released yesterday little Ohad was abducted during a holiday visit to his grandparents at the near Oz Kuts the reunion in one of the special Hospital units set up for hostages near Tel Aviv What A Difference A Day Makes in a video released by Hamas yesterday we saw Ohad whose nine Karen his mother and Ruth his grandmother handed over to the Red Cross in Gaza Karen's brother was murdered on the 7th as you'd expect most of the hostages in the video looked frightened and disorientated others though stoical 78-year-old margarite Moses even manages a wave and this is yafa Adar whose 85 the oldest of the hostages taken the Holocaust Survivor is a founder of the near o kabot 80 people are thought to have been kidnapped from there nearly quarter of the small community's population the video of her being paraded through Gaza in a golf cart became one of those terrifying totemic images of the attack the family released these pictures of heart today yaffa's grandson Tamir though is still thought to be in the hands of Hamas it's difficult to glean much about the pattern of releases from the profile of the people let go yesterday but some interesting detail Hannah cir is 77 it had been reported that she'd been killed during an Israeli air strike while she was being held by Palestinian Islamic Jihad the 10 hostages from Thailand agricultural workers and carers in Israel were freed because of a separate deal done between Thailand and Iran the true stopwatch started again this morning as it did yesterday the largest Consignment of Aid trucks since the beginning of the war arrived into Gaza today the effect of the deal felt almost immediately from people's demeanor to the prices in the markets of hunas Southern Gaza I feel that the situation is much better than it was before we're starting to get access to vegetables that we couldn't find before the pores now it's much easier to travel and people are able to buy things items are also cheaper now there was extremely limited access to items before so the cost was high it's far easier to get things now than it was during the war the truce holding has implications on the Diplomatic front also the longer it continues the more pressure can be applied on Benjamin Netanyahu by the International Community to reign in his bombardment of Civilian areas in Gaza I've encouraged the prime minister to uh to focus on trying to reduce the number of casualties while he is attempting to eliminate Hamas which is a legitimate objective he has tonight's gunfire outside the offer prison on the West Bank one of the injured carried through the crowd to an ambulance another rushed for treatment on a stretcher a large crowd had gathered awaiting the release of Palestinian prisoners and detainees and a reminder that a delay in this process is another moment during which the whole agreement could unravel barban reporting and just before we came on air I spoke to Mansour Schuman in K Unice in Gaza he's a Palestinian Canadian national who could have left Gaza with his wife and children but decided to stay he says to help and whatever way he can I began by asking him what the situation was like where he is at the moment today is the second day of the ceasefire agreement uh and yesterday everyone had a feeling of um happiness great joy relief um thousands of people around me who were displaced uh tried to return to their homes whether it's in the south in the West in the East and even some tried going back to their homes in the North in Gazza City in jabal and B andon and um today uh lots of them came back and many of them were very sad uh to see that their homes were unfortunately demolished to learn that they've lost neighbors relatives but in general there's a feeling of disappointment and Sadness by many who have returned now to live back in the hospital here in the refugee School centers on the streets in their temporary temps you talk about that the the feeling that people have had you know it's gone from Joy to sadness pretty quickly but practically speaking what difference is this temporary ceasefire making one of the reasons for the joy as well was the release of 39 Palestinian women and children who were imprisoned in Israeli jails for the past few years and released yesterday uh unfortunately uh today as you heard uh it seems that um there has been a disagreement uh between um Hamas and Israel and uh the there there hasn't been any prisoner exchange or release from both sides uh so there's also a general feeling that the war might start again so there's a fear again of uncertainty with the air strikes that might come in together with land Invasion obviously one aspect of this truce agreement was to get Aid back into Gaza have you seen that Aid coming through has it made a difference to the Europe ability to get food to get clean water so it's been 50 days since the start of this conflict and razza used to receive at least 500 trucks every day and we had only 1,100 trucks enter before this ceasefire agreement and many of these 1,100 trucks either had two or three pallets only had expired Goods expired food uh had things that we didn't really need like gloves like masks like coffin wraps for the dead um yesterday 196 trucks were let in together with four um fuel tanks uh so that was definitely helpful but again 200 trucks versus 20 or 25,000 is very minute and no we haven't seen any of it here I mean can I just ask you finally a very personal question I mean you took a decision not to leave with your family your wife and five children were able to leave earlier in the month you decided to stay I mean given everything that's happened given everything we've seen I just wonder whether you regret that decision at all whether you feel nervous about the future for yourself I wouldn't have changed it for the world my name is still in the ra border I can still leave if I want and um honestly it's a privilege it's an honor for me doing what I'm doing here trying to serve my people explaining to the people what's going on here man Shan thank you very much for talking to us today thank you ma' appreciate well here in London tens of thousands of people were again on the streets calling for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza ahead of the March the Metropolitan Police issued leaflets warning people about words or images that could break the law Jane de reports freee free free tens of thousands of people came out in the cold to call for a permanent ceasefire in the Israel Gaza conflict this was the first March in London since the Armistice Day protest and there was a new approach from the Metropolitan Police which has come in for criticism for how it's handled previous demonstrations for the first time the Metropolitan Police has been moved to hand out these leaflets it says to clarify what would cause offense and land people in the Cs it talks about words or images that are racist or incite hatred support Hamas or promote acts of terrorism the force will also have trained spotters along the Route looking out for banners or chance which cross the line although it has not been explicit about which phrases it believes could break the law from the river to the sea that chant is now the subject of fierce debate its Defenders say it calls for the end of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank but some including the former Home Secretary Suella braan have said it calls for the destruction of Israel we don't welcome anybody to attend our marks who's bringing anything that we would Define as racist uh and offensive uh and not in accordance with the principles on which we're marching do you welcome those who chant you know the chant I mean they chant that chant from The River To The Sea absolutely and we will be chanting it ourselves and I speak as a Palestinian and the vast majority of Palestinians use that charm you don't find that racist or inciting no it's a legitimate charm we don't only tolerate it we encourage people have you had any guidance from the Met as to whether they would consider that to fall within RAC they have they have never indicated to us and they would be acting outside of the law I would argue if they tried to assert uh that that chance was in any way uh an expression of anti-Semitism or a denial of the rights of another people the Metropolitan people police told us officers judging what's unlawful consider the context and on a protest like this singing from The River To The Sea probably wouldn't be an offense have you seen this leaflet today yes what do you think about it I think it's good that the police are giving it out because we need to get our message across without being violent or anything like that we're still promoting human rights we're promoting their you know the preserving life and what's wrong with that and we're doing it peacefully if if you get like a few you know small minority of idiots that turn up and basically you know ta whatever they want that's that's the job of the police they're there to enforce the law but generally on the whole you know if you if you look at the general public the well behave there were a small number of arrests which the Met was quick to publicize it posted this video online showing officers arresting a man on suspicion of supporting a prescribed organization five people were arrested over signs or material featuring Nazi symbols and at a separate protest by the islamist group hisb at the Egyptian embassy police say they arrested two women holding offensive signs well back to our main story now the delay in the second round of Hostage releases due to take place in Gaza today our Foreign Affairs correspondent poric O'Brien joined us again from Tel Aviv poric what can you tell us well Jackie a lot has happened since we last spoke 25 minutes ago first off the Egyptians said that they had managed to iron out what was stopping the what was delaying this deal they're one of the intermediaries here then the qataris they didn't confirm that either way but in the last few minutes the Israeli media is reporting that those problems have been solved the Israeli government according to the Israeli media saying that the deal is going ahead and that there may be extra foreign hostages um released what's at stake here you saw some of those images earlier in my report of large groups of angry people you know kicking off outside the prison where some of the releases of Palestinians was going to take place people get angrier and angrier the longer this is delayed and that is before we even start to talk about those families waiting all around Israel and and Tel Aviv where we are waiting for news of their loved ones how agonizing must this delay be for them poric thanks very much are giving us that update and that story clearly moving"}, "SRQjdvchUmU": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRQjdvchUmU", "video_id": "SRQjdvchUmU", "description": "13 Israelis were freed from

THEY ARE NOW WITH THE RED CROSS BEFORE THEY WILL BE BROUGHT BACK TO ISRAEL LATER THIS MORNING. >> THE RELEASE IS PART OF A DEAL BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS THAT'S BEEN IN NEGOTIATIONS FOR WEEKS. ISRAEL HAS AGREED TO A TEMPORARY CEASE-FIRE AND THE RELEASE OF DOZENS OF PALESTINIAN PRISONERS. >> RAF SANCHEZ IS ON THE GROUND WITH THE LATEST. BRICK US BRING US UP TO SPEED. >> Reporter: THAT DIPLOMAT WITH KNOWLEDGE OF THE SITUATION SAYING THOSE 13 ISRAELI WOMEN AND CHILDREN ARE NOW FREE FROM HAMAS CAPTIVITY AFTER 49 DAYS. THEY ARE IN THE CUSTODY OF THE RED CROSS. THIS DIPLOMAT SAYS, AND THEY ARE HEADING OR MAY HAVE ALREADY ARRIVED AT THE RAFAH CROSSING IN EGYPT. WE ARE EXPECTING FROM THERE THAT THEY WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE ISRAELI MILITARY AT THE ISRAELI-EGYPT BORDER. ISRAELI FORCES THERE WILL VISUALLY IDENTIFY EACH OF THESE HOSTAGES BECAUSE THEY DO NOT TRUST THAT HAMAS HAS NECESSARILY DELIVERED THOSE 13 NAMES THAT\nTHEY SAID THEY WOULD. THEY SAID THEY WOULD. THE HOSTAGES WILL BE GIVEN ON THE SPOT MEDICAL CHECKS AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEARLY SEVEN WEEKS THEY WILL BE ABLE TO CALL THEIR FAMILIES AND TELL THEM THEY ARE OKAY. WE ARE LEARNING FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF THAILAND THAT IN ADDITION TO THOSE 13 ISRAELI HOSTAGES, 12 THAI NATIONALS HAVE ALSO BEEN RELEASED. THESE ARE, WE BELIEVE, AGRICULTURAL WORKERS WHO WERE WORKING IN THOSE ISRAELI COMMUNITIES IN THE SOUTH ON THE 7th OF OCTOBER, AND WERE TAKEN HOSTAGE AS WELL DURING THAT HAMAS TERROR ATTACK. NOW, THOSE 12 WERE NOT PART OF THESE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS, MEDIATED BY THE UNITED STATES AND BY QATAR. HAMAS SAYS IT PLANS TO RELEASE THOSE THAI CITIZENS WITH NO PRE-CONDITIONS, WE ARE EXPECTING 25 HOSTAGES IN TOTAL, FREED FROM HAMAS CAPTIVITY. WE DO NOT, AT THIS MOMENT, KNOW WHO THOSE 13 ISRAELI WOMEN AND CHILDREN ARE, BUT EARLIER THIS MORNING A SENIOR U.S. OFFICIAL SAID NO AMERICANS ARE EXPECTED TO BE PART OF TODAY'S RELEASE. NOW, THAT IS A PAINFUL BLOW TO THE AMERICAN FAMILIES WAITING FOR NEWS, BUT ESPECIALLY THE FAMILY OF THAT AMERICAN TODDLER ABIGAIL MOR EDAN WHO TURNS 4 YEARS OLD TODAY. PRESIDENT BIDEN SAID OVERNIGHT FROM NANTUCKET HE WAS HOPEFUL THAT SHE MIGHT BE RELEASED TODAY, BUT AS I SAID THAT SENIOR U.S. OFFICIAL SAYING WE ARE NOT EXPECTING ANY AMERICANS TO BE FREED RIGHT NOW. ONCE THOSE HOSTAGES ARE BACK IN ISRAELI CUSTODY, THEY WILL BE TAKEN TO AN AIR BASE IN THE SOUTH OF ISRAEL, WHICH HAS BEEN CONVERTED INTO A MEDICAL CENTER, AND FROM THERE THEY WILL BE FLOWN BY HELICOPTER TO VARIOUS HOSPITALS ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, AND IT IS AT THAT POINT THAT WE EXPECT THEM TO ONCE AGAIN BE REUNITED IN PERSON WITH THEIR LOVED ONES THE BEGINNING OF WHAT IS GOING TO BE A LONG, PAINFUL, DIFFICULT HEALING JOURNEY, BUT A FIRST STEP. AND THE ISRAELI MILITARY HAS GIVEN A LOT OF THOUGHT ABOUT HOW TO HANDLE THESE HOSTAGES WHO WE BELIEVE HAVE SPENT MOST IF NOT ALL OF THE LAST 49 DAYS IN TUNNELS UNDERNEATH GAZA CITY. THEY MAY BE IN NEED OF ACUTE MEDICAL CARE. WE DO NOT KNOW IF THEY HAVE SEEN THE SUNLIGHT. THE ISRAELI MILITARY PLANNING TO PROVIDE NOISE-CANCELLING HEADPHONES TO THOSE LITTLE CHILDREN AND TELLING THE SOLDIERS TO LEAVE THEIR FACES UNCOVERED AND TO SMILE TO REASSURE THE KIDS. NOW, THIS IS DAY ONE OF WHAT IS PLANNED TO BE A FOUR-DAY CEASE-FIRE WITH AROUND 12 HOSTAGES RELEASED EVERY DAY. AND IN EXCHANGE ISRAEL RELEASING PALESTINIAN WOMEN AND MALE TEENAGERS FROM ISRAELI PRISONS. THEY HAVE BEEN GATHERED, THOSE PRISONERS, AT A FACILITY IN THE OCCUPIED WEST BANK AHEAD OF THEIR RELEASE. AND THE HOPE IS THAT TODAY'S DEAL WILL HOLD, THE CEASE-FIRE WILL HOLD, AND THAT EVERY DAY FOR THE NEXT FOUR DAYS WE WILL SEE MORE HOSTAGES COMING OUT OF GAZA. GUYS? >> AND RAF, AS WE SEE SOME OF THOSE LIVE PICTURES IN THE VIDEO OF WHERE WE THINK THIS TRANSFER MAY HAPPEN, WE'RE FOLLOWING THOSE DEVELOPMENTS. I DO HAVE TO ASK YOU, BECAUSE SPEAKING TO THE FAMILIES OF THOSE HOSTAGES, THE TRAUMA THEY HAVE BEEN PUT THROUGH OVER THESE LAST SEVEN WEEKS, RAF, WHAT MORE DO WE KNOW ON HOW HAMAS IS DECIDING TO GETS TO GO, AND WHO WILL STAY SOMEWHERE IN GAZA, LIKELY TORTURED, BEING HELD UNDERNEATH IN THOSE TUNNELS? >> Reporter: SO, TOM, WE KNOW THAT THIS DEAL FOR THE FIRST 50 ISRAELI HOSTAGES IS WOMEN AND CHILDREN ONLY. WE ARE NOT EXPECTING ANY MEN TO COME OUT AS PART OF THIS DEAL. WE ARE CERTAINLY NOT EXPECTING ANY OF THOSE ISRAELI SOLDIERS. WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE QATARI GOVERNMENT WHO BROKERED THIS DEAL THAT THE PLAN IS TO KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER AS THESE BATCHES OF HOSTAGES ARE RELEASED, AND WE DO BELIEVE THAT THESE FAMILIES, THESE HOSTAGES ARE GOING TO BE RELEASED IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY WERE TAKEN FROM. SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WE MAY SEE THEM RELEASED ONE KIBBUTZ AT A TIME, ONE COMMUNITY AT A TIME. AGAIN, WE DO NOT HAVE CONFIRMATION OF EXACTLY WHO IS PART OF THIS INITIAL GROUP OF 13, BUT WE DO HOPE TO SEE IN THE COMING HOURS WHEN WE GET OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION FROM THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON, THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT THIS FOUR-DAY CEASE-FIRE COULD BE EXTENDED, ONE ADDITIONAL DAY OF CEASE-FIRE IN EXCHANGE FOR TEN MORE HOSTAGES, THE QATARIs WERE CLEAR, THEY STRUCTURED THIS DEAL TO INCENTIVIZE BOTH SIDES TO ABIDE BY TERMS, HAMAS WOULD GET MORE DAYS OF ITS CEASE-FIRE IF IT RELEASES HOSTAGE, ISRAEL METS MORE HOSTAGES IF IT HOLDS OFF ITS STRIKES INSIDE OF GAZA. HOW LONG THIS CEASE-FIRE CAN HOLD REMAINS TO BE SEEN. WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN LARGE CROWDS OF PALESTINIANS INSIDE OF GAZA DISPLACED FROM THEIR HOMES WHO WANT TO RETURN TO THEM UP IN THE NORTH. THE ASSOCIATED PRESS REPORTING AT LEAST TWO PALESTINIANS HAVE BEEN KILLED SO FAR BY ISRAELI FIRE INSIDE GAZA SINCE THE CEASE-FIRE WENT INTO EFFECT. WE ASKED THE ISRAELI MILITARY ABOUT THAT, THEY SAID THAT THEY WERE LOOKING INTO IT. BUT, THE HOPE IS THAT THIS IS PROOF OF CONCEPT, THAT THERE CAN BE AN EXCHANGE BETWEEN THESE MORTAL ENEMIES, ISRAEL AND HAMAS, THAT THERE CAN BE NEGOTIATIONS THAT LEAD TO THE RELEASE OF THE HOSTAGES AND HOPEFULLY THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF A PROCESS THAT WE'LL SEE MORE OF THEM EMERGING. >> RAF, THANK YOU FOR BEING ON THIS STORY FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF IT. NOW LET'S BRING IN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT KELLY O'DONNELL IN NANTUCKET WHERE PRESIDENT BIDEN IS SPENDING THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND. KELLY, GOOD MORNING TO YOU. NO AMERICANS RELEASED AS PART OF THIS DEAL. WHAT IS THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING THIS MORNING TO AMERICAN FAMILIES, INCLUDING THE FAMILY OF A GIRL WHO'S SUPPOSED TO TURN 4 YEARS OLD? >> Reporter: WELL, THE CONCERN, OF COURSE, IS COULD THERE BE ANYTHING THAT WOULD ALTER THE PLAN, AND AT THIS POINT I'VE BEEN TALKING WITH A NUMBER OF WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS, THEY'RE WATCHING THIS CLOSELY, IT IS STILL THEIR EXPECTATION THAT AMERICANS WILL ULTIMATELY BE TRANSFERRED OUT OF THE CUSTODY OF HAMAS, BUT NOT TODAY. AND OF COURSE THAT IS DISAPPOINTING, AND THEY ARE WATCHING THIS AS IT'S DEVELOPING, A NUMBER OF OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THAT THEY ARE CONFIDENT THAT THE DEAL IS HOLDING. BUT OF COURSE IT IS SUCH A FRAGILE SITUATION. THE PRESIDENT HAS INDICATED THAT HE DID NOT WANT TOO SAY ANYTHING PUBLICLY UNTIL THIS TRANSFER WOULD TAKE PLACE. WE HAVE NOT YET HAD AN UPDATE ON THE PRESIDENT'S SCHEDULE TODAY. I AM TOLD THEY ARE TRYING TO ASSESS THE NEXT STEPS FOR HOW THE PRESIDENT WOULD BE PUBLICLY INVOLVED. PRIVATELY WE CAN TELL YOU HE HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY INVOLVED ON THE PHONE WITH OFFICIALS FROM BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, THE PRIME MINISTER, TALKING WITH THE AMIR OF QATAR, DEALING WITH THIS, WITH PERSONAL DIPLOMACY AND THEN OF COURSE HE HAS DEPLOYED A NUMBER OF OF TOP OFFICIALS ON THE GROUND AND SHUTTLING BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THE WHITE HOUSE IS WATCHING THIS AND WE EXPECT TO HEAR MORE SHORTLY FROM ONE OFFICIAL WE HEARD FROM A SHORT TIME AGO BUT IT WAS DISAPPOINTING TO NOT HAVE AMERICANS IN THE INITIAL TRANSFER OF HOSTAGES. THE EXPECTATION IS THAT AMERICANS WILL BE INCLUDED AND OF COURSE THIS KEEPS THE PRESSURE ON, IT KEEPS LEVERAGE FOR HAMAS IN THESE ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS, AND AND IT HAS BEEN SENSITIVE, BUT THE WHITE HOUSE WOULD INDICATE THIS IS LOOKING LIKE PROGRESS AND THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE. SO, WE HOPE TO HEAR MORE FROM THE PRESIDENT WHILE HE IS HERE WITH FAMILY DOING THE THINGS OTHER AMERICAN FAMILIES ARE DOING BUT HE HAS CERTAINLY BEEN DEEPLY ENGAGED IN THIS ALL MORNING. LAURA? >> KELLY, I'LL PICK IT UP, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR REPORTING. AGAIN, IF YOU'RE JUST TUNING IN, 13 ISRAELI HOSTAGES HAVE BEEN RELEASED. SO FAR, NO AMERICANS, WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THIS BREAKING STORY THROUGHOUT THE DAY, STAY WITH NBCNEWS.COM, AND STREAMING OF COURSE, NBC NEWS NOW FOR ALL THE NEW DEVELOPMENTS.

THE CENTER OF THREE RELIGIOUS FAITHS, THE AREA HAS BEEN CONQUERED, CONTESTED AND RULED BY VARIOUS EMPIRES ACROSS MILLENNIA.  JOHN YANG TAKES A LOOK AT THE MOST RECENT HISTORY OF CONFLICT AND CONQUEST, AND OF SUFFERING AND STRIFE THAT HAS LED THE REGION TO WHERE IT IS TODAY. JOHN: FROM ITS VERY FOUNDING, THE STATE OF ISRAEL HAS BEEN SHAPED BY MODERN WAR. AND ANCIENT NARRATIVES INSCRIBED OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS ABOUT WHO CONTROLS THE LAND BETWEEN THE RIVER JORDAN AND THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA.  >> SAUDI ARABIA. NO. SOVIET UNION. YES. UNITED KINGDOM, ABSTAINS. UNITED STATES, YES. JOHN: IN NOVEMBER 1947, IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE HOLOCAUST, THE UNITED NATIONS VOTED TO PARTITION WHAT WAS THEN THE BRITISH MANDATE OF PALESTINE INTO TWO INDEPENDENT STATES -- ONE JEWISH, ONE ARAB.  JERUSALEM, FOUGHT OVER FOR CENTURIES, WAS TO BE UNDER INTERNATIONAL ADMINISTRATION.  THE CITY IS CENTRAL TO THREE MAJOR RELIGIONS -- JUDAISM, CHRISTIANITY, AND ISLAM.  A SMALL AREA IS ONE OF THE MOST SACRED SITES FOR BOTH JEWS AND MUSLIMS -- THE WESTERN WALL, THE REMNANTS OF THE FIRST AND SECOND JEWISH TEMPLES. AND ABOVE IT, TEMPLE MOUNT, ALSO HALLOWED GROUND FOR MUSLIMS, WHO REFER TO IT AS AL HARAM AL-SHARIF, THE NOBLE SANCTUARY. IN 1948, ISRAEL DECLARED INDEPENDENCE, WHICH WAS FOLLOWED BY THE FIRST OF WHAT WOULD BE MANY WARS BETWEEN ISRAEL AND ITS ARAB NEIGHBORS.  HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ARABS WERE EVICTED. AN EVENT KNOWN IN THE ARAB WORLD AS THE NAKBA, \"THE CATASTROPHE.\" MORE THAN HALF A MILLION FLED TO REFUGEE CAMPS IN THE WEST BANK, GAZA, JORDAN, LEBANON, AND SYRIA.  >> SOME WERE EXPELLED BY FORCE, SOME WERE TERRORIZED AND FLED.  JOHN: HISTORIAN YEZID SAYIGH WAS A PALESTINIAN NEGOTIATOR IN PEACE TALKS IN THE 1990'S.  >> THESE WERE THE PEOPLE WHO WENT FROM BEING FARMERS AND PEASANTS TO BEING REFUGEES TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON HANDOUTS.   JOHN: IN 1967, WITH STUNNING SPEED, ISRAEL DEFEATED A SURPRISE ATTACK BY EGYPT, JORDAN, AND SYRIA IN THE SIX-DAY WAR. SEIZING GAZA FROM EGYPT, THE GOLAN HEIGHTS FROM SYRIA, AND FROM JORDAN, THE WEST BANK AND THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN OF THREE FAITHS, EAST JERUSALEM. THOUSANDS OF ISRAELIS WOULD MOVE TO THOSE TERRITORIES AND SETTLE, VIOLATING INTERNATIONAL LAW SET BY THE UNITED NATIONS.  PALESTINIAN RESISTANCE GROUPS STEPPED UP TERROR ATTACKS. A TACTIC BACKED BY THE PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION, OR PLO, WHICH STARTED TO REPRESENT PALESTINIANS ON THE WORLD STAGE IN THE MID-1960'S. THIS INCLUDED AIRLINER HIJACKINGS AND THE 1972 MUNICH OLYMPIC MASSACRE, A TERRORIST ATTACK THAT PLAYED OUT ON TELEVISION SCREENS ACROSS THE WORLD AND ENDED WITH THE DEATHS OF 11 ISRAELIS, ONE GERMAN POLICE OFFICER, AND FIVE PALESTINIAN GUNMEN.  THEN, IN DECEMBER 1987, A COMBINATION OF FACTORS LED TO LARGELY SPONTANEOUS PALESTINIAN PROTESTS, CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE, AND VIOLENT ATTACKS AGAINST ISRAELI SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS. IT WAS THE FIRST PALESTINIAN INTIFADA, OR \"UPRISING.\" THE ISRAELI MILITARY RESPONDED WITH BRUTAL FORCE, AND OUT OF THE FIRST INTIFADA EMERGED HAMAS. >> WHEN HAMAS EMERGED UNDER ISRAELI MILITARY OCCUPATION, THE ISRAELI APPROACH WAS TO TOLERATE IT. JOHN: YOSSI ALPHER IS A FORMER MOSSAD OFFICIAL AND FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE JAFFEE CENTER FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES AT TEL AVIV UNIVERSITY. >> IT WAS CONSIDERED TO BE STRICTLY RELIGIOUS, NOT POLITICAL. THAT ILLUSION DID NOT LAST LONG. IT WAS SEEN AS A KIND OF FOIL THAT ISRAEL COULD MANIPULATE AGAINST THE PLO.   JOHN: IN 1988, PLO LEADER YASSER ARAFAT RECOGNIZED ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO EXIST, BUT HAMAS HELD TO ITS BELIEF THAT ISRAEL SHOULD BE ELIMINATED. >> THEY WANTED TO APPEAR MORE MILITANT. IT'S HUGELY IRONIC THAT, OF COURSE, ISRAEL AT THAT TIME HAD AN INTEREST IN TOLERATING HAMAS, IF NOT ACTIVELY ENCOURAGING IT UNTIL, YOU KNOW, THE APPRENTICE TURNED ON THE SORCERER, SO TO SPEAK.  JOHN: IN 1989, ARAFAT SPOKE FROM EXILE IN TUNISIA WITH THE LATE JIM LEHRER.   >> YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HOW DIFFICULT OUR LIVES ARE AS REFUGEES, AS HOMELESS, STATELESS. >> DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU ARE CLOSE TO ACHIEVING THIS, ACHIEVING YOUR STATE? >> YES. >> HOW CLOSE, HOW MUCH TIME WILL IT TAKE? >> NOT MORE THAN A DISTANCE OF A STONE'S THROW. JOHN: A DISTANCE THAT, FOR PALESTINIANS, PROVED TOO FAR. THE INTIFADA LASTED ANOTHER FOUR YEARS. ALMOST 2000 WERE KILLED, WITH PALESTINIAN DEATHS OUTNUMBERING ISRAELI DEATHS THREE TO ONE.  HOPE FOR PEACE CAME IN 1993, WHEN THE PLO AND ISRAEL SIGNED THE FIRST OSLO ACCORDS, THE PRODUCT OF SECRET TALKS OVERSEEN BY THE NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT. BOTH SIDES COMMITTED TO NEGOTIATING AN END TO THE CONFLICT AND CHARTING A PATH TO PALESTINIAN SELF-RULE IN THE WEST BANK AND GAZA.  IT TRIGGERED A VIOLENT BACKLASH FROM RELIGIOUS EXTREMISTS AMONG BOTH ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS, INCLUDING HAMAS.  >> I AM VERY SAD AND VERY SHOCKED. JOHN: AND IN 1995, A RIGHT-WING JEWISH EXTREMIST ASSASSINATED ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER YITZHAK RABIN. THE NEXT YEAR, BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, AN OUTSPOKEN CRITIC OF THE ACCORDS AND LEADER OF THE RIGHT-WING LIKUD PARTY, WAS ELECTED PRIME MINISTER.  >> NETANYAHU BASICALLY SAID OSLO IS A MISTAKE. THIS WAS THE POSITION OF THE SETTLERS, THE POSITION OF THE RIGHT WING. NETANYAHU VERY MUCH RODE TO POWER PRESENTING HIMSELF AS THE EXPERT ON TERRORISM. JOHN: BY 1999, LIKUD HAD BEEN DEFEATED AND NETANYAHU REPLACED AS PARTY LEADER BY ARIEL SHARON, A FORMER MILITARY COMMANDER. A YEAR LATER, SHARON LED A MARCH ON THE TEMPLE MOUNT TO ASSERT ISRAELI CLAIMS TO THE BITTERLY-CONTESTED SITE.  THE STREETS OF EAST JERUSALEM AND RAMALLAH IN THE WEST BANK ERUPTED IN VIOLENCE.  THE SECOND INTIFADA WAS UNDERWAY. FIVE YEARS OF PALESTINIAN SUICIDE BOMBERS DETONATING THEMSELVES IN ISRAELI BUSES AND CAFES.  SHARON, BY THEN PRIME MINISTER, ORDERED ISRAELI TROOPS INTO THE WEST BANK AND GAZA. THE SECOND INTIFADA'S DEATH TOLL SURPASSED 4300 PEOPLE. AGAIN, MORE PALESTINIANS THAN ISRAELIS. >> RATHER THAN IMMEDIATELY CLAMP DOWN IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THE PEACE PROCESS, ARAFAT CYNICALLY THOUGHT THAT THE VIOLENCE WOULD ACT AS LEVERAGE. THIS IS A TOTAL MISREADING OF DYNAMICS ON THE ISRAELI SIDE, A TOTAL STRATEGIC MISTAKE.  THE SECOND INTIFADA KILLED ANY RESIDUAL READINESS ON THE PART OF THE ISRAELI PUBLIC TO BACK THE OSLO PROCESS AND TO CONTINUE TURNING OVER TERRITORIES. JOHN: ISRAEL BEGAN BUILDING A SECURITY WALL BETWEEN THE WEST BANK AND ISRAEL, AND RENEWED EXPANSION OF WEST BANK JEWISH SETTLEMENTS. IN LATE 2003, PRIME MINISTER SHARON PROPOSED UNILATERALLY PULLING ALL ISRAELI TROOPS FROM GAZA AND DISMANTLING THE SETTLEMENTS THERE. >> IT PAINS ME A LOT, BUT I'VE REACHED A DECISION AND I AM GOING TO CARRY IT OUT. JOHN: IN AUGUST 2005, SOME 8000 ISRAELI SETTLERS ABANDONED 21 SETTLEMENTS. ISRAEL GAVE UP ALL GOVERNING AUTHORITY INSIDE GAZA, BUT CONTINUED TO CONTROL ITS BORDERS. THE NEXT YEAR, HAMAS WON GAZA'S FIRST LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS IN A DECADE. FATAH, THE PARTY AFFILIATED WITH THE PLO, PLACED SECOND. TENSIONS AMONG PALESTINIAN FACTIONS WOULD GO FROM BAD TO WORSE. THE HAMAS LEADERS IN GAZA PRESSED THEIR HARD LINE TOWARD ISRAEL. >> ISRAEL IS OUR ENEMY WHO OCCUPIED OUR LAND AND KILLED OUR LEADERS AND DEMOLISHED OUR HOMES AND JAILED OUR SONS AND UPROOTED OUR TREES. WE WILL NEVER BE ITS ALLY. JOHN: HAMAS ROUTED FATAH FROM GAZA IN EARLY 2007, PUTTING CONTROL OF THE TERRITORIES UNDER DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTS. GAZA RULED BY HAMAS, AND THE WEST BANK GOVERNED BY THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY. ISRAEL IMPOSED A BLOCKADE ON GAZA, LIMITING THE MOVEMENT OF GOODS AND PEOPLE IN AND OUT. IT WAS, IN PART, A RESPONSE TO CONTINUED HAMAS ATTACKS OUT OF THE GAZA STRIP. THE U.N. SAYS THE BLOCKADE HAS DEEPENED THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS FOR THE MORE THAN TWO MILLION PALESTINIANS LIVING THERE.  >> YOU CAN IMAGINE SOCIALLY, POLITICALLY, PERSONALLY, ETHICALLY WHAT THAT MEANT.

"transcript": "there are a variety of scenarios from here no one knows where we go and there are certainly some scenarios in which the damage remains tragic and upsetting but limited and there are other scenarios whereby certain key dominoes topple and that starts a chain reaction which can lead to a regional conflagration and potentially even worse you say the Potential Threat to economies and markets will depend on the size and degree of the conflict it's itself but how will the West be affected if the war expands well the real problem here is energy because if the war expands into a geography which starts to impact energy production and energy Supply we risk rerunning the kind of Crisis that we saw with Russian gas flows into Europe in 2022 and we hoped we'd put those episodes behind us this year could potentially see a repeat what would have to happen for that eventuality to play out for that eventuality to play out we would have to see the Domino's topple such that Iran Saudi Arabia K uh the UAE other oil producers in that particular region would either end up at daggers drawn with each other uh in the absolute worst case scenario or seeing significant us sanctions as a milder version of it or some combination of the two and were that to happen plus additionally maybe the Suz Canal being affected in some subsets of some scenarios we're looking at much High Global Energy prices and much higher Global inflation let's talk about the price of oil how high do you see it climbing well our energy expert Joe Dela believes that in the kind of scenarios we're looking at here it's a minimum of $150 a barrel a minimum and if you start looking at some of the really worst case scenarios whereby on top of this uh geopolitical actors like Russia say okay this would be a good time to turn the Taps off as well just to you know kick a man while he's down so to speak it could be even higher than that how would the scenario which you are depicting interrupt other key commodity supplies well if the soz canal in particular is affected that certainly can slow down the delivery of many Commodities they couldn't go through that key trade conduit they'd have to go Around the Horn of Africa and even there if we're getting into a truly Global conflagration or at least a global standoff you have to wonder would even the Horn of Africa be safe either from Pirates or from potential Naval activity from other from other parties so it's entirely inflationary and the only question is just how bad it gets how fast were that to occur China signed a 25-year cooperation deal with Iran in 2020 if Iran enters the Israel Gaza war is China likely to become involved too not directly I don't think anyone's expecting the Chinese military to be projecting Force to that region that's something they're not capable of yet but as we've seen in recent years there are plenty of ways that actors can lean uh heavily in terms of economic pressure to make things much more painful for countries that are trying to prosecute a war as we saw in 2022 and so indirectly what could you see from China if this scenario was to play out well first of all we already see one happening as I'm speaking to you today which is in the South China Sea there's a standoff now between Philippines forces and Chinese forces what they're attempting to do is see will the US show that it still has the metal and literally the metal me to stand behind the Philippines when it's being sucked in on two different fronts simultaneously can it do it on three and at the same time in a more passive sense China could suddenly have a problem with production in certain key plants it could have a problem supplying us with key inputs XY Z ABC which would be very disruptive for our production processes and inflationary again maybe that could happen you WR a very interesting point is the US going to be able to support itself if called on in three separate conflicts well the US likes to think of itself as the arsenal of democracy and it's still the world's primary military power but if you're talking potentially about an escalation in the Ukraine war requiring more and more us physical support if you're talking about a worst case scenario of a Middle East War dragging in many many countries at the same time requiring us firefighting ability as it were and if you're talking about the us being tested in the Indo Pacific at exactly the same time there are limits to even what the US can do particularly in an election year Australia's PM is meeting Joe Biden this week and China's president she in a fortnight the timing of his meetings with key players aside does it appear to you as though the Australia China trade war is drawing to an end yes and no I think we can see that certain Key Products may see tariffs lowered and that's good news for Australia if that's the case but anyone who thinks we're moving towards an era of you know free trade free hugs and free love is very very wrong the global backdrop is moving depressingly in the complete opposite direction and I don't think that bilateral relationship will prove immune to that Trend in the long run what do you see then as to the future of the relationship between China and Australia well we're in a period of global fragmentation very clearly it's happening faster in some regions than in others um and it's happening more aggressively in some regions than others and we've obviously seen a very aggressive China Australia Dynamic over the past few years so if we have partial Deton on that front fantastic but as we saw in the previous cold war between the US and the USSR you had periods of Deton and then you have periods of much you know more heated confrontation or cold war confrontation and sadly I expect with the present backdrop and the fact that China seems to be on one side in particular this will just reoccur and I think most key players in the industries affected are well aware of that fact"}, "Mwq8E48yoe8": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwq8E48yoe8", "video_id": "Mwq8E48yoe8", "description": "Subscribe here: http://9Soci.al/chmP50wA97J Full Episodes:

"EXPLAINER: What you need to know about the war in Israel and Palestine | 60 Minutes Australia", "uploader": "60 Minutes Australia", "transcript": "you wanted to raise the point of international interest in the region or was it International reaction to the region well I think it's more accurate to say the international non-reaction because every time there is a cycle of violence the International Community focuses on what is happening uh you know words of concern condemnation and so on but as soon as the violence subsides everyone's gone to other places around the world where fires are burning yes and and the situation Remains the Same on until the next cycle of violence goes on because there no solution at hand and the International Community has to pay or play a much stronger role in helping or forcing the sides or incentivizing the sides into more you know what would be painful con uh concessions but still important ones in the long term meeting the competing needs of the Palestinians and the Israelis is the most complex challenge isn't it yes exactly Israel for a long time has tried to uh assert its uh forceful powers in order to meet its uh uh security needs but at the expense of the needs of the Palestinian people and that is not sustainable long term so there has to be some shift and find a way to meet the uh needs of both people for a sustainable peace uh between the two people otherwise it it wouldn't work but what is stopping meeting the needs you know you've got Security on one hand you have a a freedom I guess on the other why are they not being met I think potentially most needs of both people are quite compatible but on both Sid you have the extreme Elements which want more which is you know the radical uh Jews on one side and the radical islamists on the other and a solution would have to uh involve the main people on both sides saying this is enough we have to take care of our own without expecting to get everything in return it might be early in the piece to be asking this question but right now is there any hope of Peace well there was no hope for peace in the short and medium term before uh this last weekend's events but my feeling is that uh the Hope For Peace has deteriorated significantly since you speak to both sides gazans and Israelis and they say they want to live in peace it seems like that that choice is completely out of their hands in the foreseeable future certainly uh peace will depend on a great level of trust between the sides and that trust has been shattered and I don't know how long it will take to rebuild it because every time a cycle of violence goes on it goes further back do you expect this war as it is now being described to be limited to Israel and Palestine or Gaza and the Israeli territories well there's a lot of uh International forces that are working behind the scenes and and uh presently in the area to try and prevent that the Americans have sent uh warships and and aircraft carriers to make sure that uh this does not happen and there is a lot of uh work being done by Western Powers by by Arab states to try and prevent that so uh hopefully that will not happen Israel is mobilized uh up to in in two weeks time they'll have half a million soldiers that will not only be or most of them actually will not be uh around Gaz Gaza but in other parts in the north and and around the the West Bank to try and ensure that this does not happen so hopefully uh no one knows but hopefully this will be enough to deter escalation when you look at the role of other players in this in the lead up to the attacks what role do you believe Iran played and what role do you believe it will play into the future and included in that is Lebanon with Hezbollah well there's a lot of a debate going on at the moment about the role that Iran had played uh with some conflicting uh information but certainly Iran as a major backer of Hamas has had some something to do uh what it was I'm not sure but Hamas couldn't have pulled it off without at least Iranian knowledge if not help so uh how will that uh evolve is very difficult uh to know but uh certainly uh Iran creates a a major issue for stab stabilization of the situation at the moment the threat of another front if you like with Hezbollah how how real is that again we're speculating here but kisah is uh uh being the major power in Lebanon is still beholden to the Lebanese people and Lebanon is in such a worse or or such a terrible economic situation that a fullscale war against Israel will be impossible to handle and so my hope is that uh this will play a major role inah's calculations meaning that they'll stay out of it hard to predict but my sense is that together with the presence of the Americans uh at Lebanon Shore uh that they will stay out of it but again uh they are also and Iran is beholden to some extent to the Hamas and if Hamas is about to be decimated if there is a ground assault then it's very difficult to know at the moment there is a uh exchanges of fire between hisbah in South Lebanon and Israel but they're both kind of making sure it doesn't go get out of uh hand so whether that will continue very hard to know what was the ambition of Hamas by by breaching security by making these assaults and these attacks on civilians what were they hoping to do again we we can point to a few key factors uh what other factors has existed uh it's hard to know at this early point but certainly uh the Abduction of Israeli citizens has been a a key uh factor and a key uh reason for previous Hamas incursions into Israel the idea is to try and uh and exchange prisoners there's thousands of Hamas and other Palestinian militants in Israeli uh prisons at the moment and uh in the past in 20 2011 for example one Israeli soldier was exchanged for a thousand Kamas and other organizations militants and so this idea is very important for Hamas uh the current head of Hamas in Gaza was spent 22 years in Israeli prison and was exchanged as part of those thousand Kamas militants that were taken back so do you think that was the primary reason for this a hostage grab I think that it was a key I think there are other factors that were in play for example uh this power struggle about the future of the West Bank between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority Hamas every time Hamas attacks it it gets uh more support among the Palestinian population there's also indication that uh sporting the uh ongoing negotiations between the US and Saudi Arabia which include normalization p act between Israel and Saudi Arabia would have been a key factor because it's against Iran Iranian interests and so Hamas as a backer of Iran would have also taken that into account surely they expected the retaliation they now receiving they they must have known that Israel would fight back yes and that was the reason for the intelligence failure because the calculations were Hamas is not interested in ation knowing what the price will be for the people of Gaza and and for itself and that's that's behind the failure uh if we calculate the number of factors that we can now see that may have led Hamas into that decision then uh the price they were willing to pay was on the back of the civilian population of Gaza as in the past so they're happy to sacrifice their own people I don't know if happy is the ter minology but prepared yes they describe it as an act of self-defense not an act of terrorism the attack on Israel on October 7th how would you describe it well I think uh in such a heated conflict uh we need to uh look at international law and there is a big difference between fighting Israeli soldiers for example which is part of which is okay so-called okay uh by international law and the targeting and intentional targeting of civilians uh especially uh what we've seen with mass atrocities killing families children and so on which is I would say even goes beyond war crimes maybe even crimes against humanity because we're talking about Mass atrocities and this is certainly uh something that uh you know will take back the struggle for uh a Palestinian State I think here years back so right now they're losing the pr War you think I think for the time being yes uh especially uh given the uh the media coverage of of the situation what will happen longer time will depend on the results of the Gaza Siege if uh the more casualties among the civilian population of Gaza uh take place the harder it will be for backers of Israel in the International Community to support these actions Israel is so wounded and so angry so hurt uh do you think they care how the world looks upon how they treat Gaza I think they do I think as you you're rightly pointing out there there's a there's been a huge trauma the entire Israeli uh public is behind very strong and aggressive action but at the same time Israel does need the support first of all and mostly of the Americans which have already pointed to international law as a as a means to regulate what is taking place next but also the international public opinion does matter and does count whether that will be the overriding factor in the decision making it's hard to say but certainly one of the many factors that they're juggling at the moment you would imagine that right now Israel feels a a need to flex its muscles to show that it might be wounded but not dead not broken completely that it is still a strength despite the breach of its security how big a factor is that in what happens next that it must do something again speculating but for me I think it will be the most important factor because Israel has now been uh for decades living on this uh ability to deter future uh violence and future incursions from different so-called enemies around around around the Middle East and without that deterrence uh there will be no sense of security no sense of safety uh with which the Israeli public cannot uh live so this will be uh the most important factor I think in the decision making but does it still have the capability to provide that security to its people and to flex its muscles in the region look I think again that will depend on the outcome of the whether Israel is able to so-call destroy the Hamas and what will be the consequences what will be the uh the uh end game uh the suffering of the Palestinian civilian population in Gaza I think Israel was surprised the huge failure by the uh Israeli intelligence but when you look at the outcome on the ground yes a thousand Israelis civilians were killed in inhumane barbaric acts but I think they've counted up till now about uh 180 Israeli soldiers dead and supposedly 1,500 uh Palestinian militants so in terms of Israel's capability to defend itself I think it's still there Hamas claims that it did not Target civilians that it only targeted soldiers it only killed soldiers what do you say to that claim I think it's a very uh very poor uh way of looking at things because uh based on what I've heard they say we are not targeting civilians because settlers are not civilians and then they were asked whether the people living in uh in near Gaza just outside Gaza which don't live in the West Bank as settlers are are included under settlers and they didn't have a good answer for that is there some semantics where they view that every Israeli is a soldier or will be or has been because they're all reservist for some stage of their life is that how they Justified it's interesting it's a it's a an argument that has been raised in the past but I haven't seen it so far uh it will it might come up sooner or later but uh it is very difficult to justify the killing of children and and old people even if you talk about reservists and and women and whole fam so uh maybe that's why they're still waiting without argument but certainly doesn't hold water there has been uh in some qu is great Sympathy for the Palestinian cause the way Palestinians have been treated by the Israeli government do you believe there's any justification for the action that we've seen in this past week I think this is an important point to make uh I myself have long supported the right of the Palestinians for for a Palestinian States but but what has happening is that uh we have the bandwagon and on the bandwagon we have some extreme ele such as Kamas jumping on and the uh tendency among you know more so-called uh sane people on that band wagon has been to uh be quiet instead of pointing out that this is really not the right way to fight for the liberation of Palestine through violence against civilian there's that uh thinking I think that if you denounce other people on the bandwagon as in the use of of violence against civilians then you are playing into the hands of Israel and undermining the struggle for a free Palestine and for me this is exactly the opposite because I think that the best service that we can do for the Palestinian people and for the Israeli people is to stop the occupation but stop the occupation in a way that will have a future for two Palestinian Palestinian State and an Israeli State living next to one another it's one thing to have Hamas 70 kilometers away from Tel Aviv and to trust that maybe future Arrangement will be made to prevent such violence and to have a Hamas controlling the West Bank 10 kilometers from Tel Aviv after what had happened I don't see how the Israeli public that is essential for deciding on a Palestinian state will be willing to take such risk this is why I mean that the cause for a free Palestine had gone Miles and Miles backwards yeah both in in in terms of policy and public opinion yes do you think that Hamas will be wiped out I mean that's the Israeli stated intention that they would want to take away their military power and their political power will they be successful it's very difficult or impossible to wipe out ideologies yes Israel can you know deal a a very very uh strong blow on Kamas capabilities if they go uh into a ground assault they can uh you know kill a lot and obviously a lot of the civilian population as well and a lot of Israelis uh would die but uh as long as there is no solution to the Israel Palestine issue then that ideology sooner or later will uh po up so uh there's no military Solution on either side for the Israeli Palestinian conflict it has to be political do you think Benjamin Netanyahu can survive this no by no means uh there's strong indication that uh under his leadership uh Hamas was allowed to grow uh and uh alongside all the failures that this government this most radical government in Israel's history had uh uh gone through including in terms of focusing on the most trivial things instead of focusing on others then uh after once the war is over he he will be oued it might be too simple to to put it in this way but it's quite ironic isn't it that somebody who is such a hawk on Security will most likely end his political career because of the failures of his security uh I think you can't really disengage or or or or differentiate between the security failure the political failure in other areas and and yes this was a combination of all of these"}, "E7tgRbiga74": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7tgRbiga74", "video_id": "E7tgRbiga74", "description": "There are fears

terror attack damaged multiple planes that were parked inside of the air base now according to the Pakistani military three non-operational aircraft were damaged by the terrorist in the Taliban link T Jihad Pakistan which has been involved in Acts of terrorism against Security Forces is now claimed responsibility for the attack now this is a newly emerged militant group that is an affiliate of the T Taliban Pakistan or the TTP now remember the TTP with links with the Afghan Taliban is a major source of security challenge for the Pakistani State the little known tjp has recently carried out multiple high-profile attacks in Pakistan including killing 12 soldiers at a Pakistani military base in Southwestern province of baluchistan in the month of July and Saturday's attack on the Pakistani Air Base has come just hours after a major attack that killed at least about 14 soldiers in the guar District two vehicles of security forces moving from pasi to orara in the huad district were ambushed by the terrorists the Pakistan's interior Minister has termed the current wave of Terror as a conspiracy to make Pakistan a target of uncertainty and instability once again now the ministers in fact vowed that all civil and Military institutions will unite to combat Terror now to give you a sense of the gravity of the situation in Pakistan we have some numbers to show you there have been a total of 422 Terror attacks in Pakistan this year and at least about 1200 people have been killed in these attacks out of which 317 are said to be civilians and 439 are members of the security forces in 2011 Pakistan's Naval Station the pns mean had come under attack in which about 16 people including 10 soldiers had been killed the attackers were all from ilas kashmir's 313 Brigade of alqaeda the analyst say the terror groups have in fact become El emboldened by the return to power of the Taliban and neighboring Afghanistan in 2021 Pakistan regularly accuses its neighbor of har harboring Terror groups who plan and also launch attacks from the Afghan soil a charge that the Taliban in Kabul has denied again it's not the only the terrorists protests also erupted across Pakistan on the 9th of May following the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan his supporters remember had back then had stormed an army base in the country's Punjab province had reportedly set a preserved Shenyang F6 aircraft on fire the twin engine F jet designed and manufactured by Shenyang aircraft Corporation of China was the first purchase of the Pakistani Air Force from Beijing talk to give us more perspective in terms of what of course is happening at this moment in Pakistan we being joined by [\u00a0__\u00a0] major yasid janwa who's a defense and strategic Affairs expert is joining us live from Islamabad this moment uh sir thank you very much indeed for taking time out and speaking to us here on VI now this is a very dramatic attack that has taken place on what should be one of the most secure locations in Pakistan it is an Air Force training base about nine of these terrorists managed to get inside the airbase and also damage several aircrafts of the Pakistani Air Force how did this happen uh well uh first and foremost thank you very much how however uh let me correct you that the the the aircraft they claim to have damaged or the ones that are reportedly being reported as damaged were non-operational obsolete aircraft were just parked there MH uh and they parked near the the fence you might say so the terrorists did not go if they were able to go inside they would have definitely caused damage so that's that's why you find that they probably clim up the letter and while they were on the wall they tried to use uh whatever weapons they had to create because they did not know these aircrafts are of no use these are do you actually believe that major when when you say that perhap they did not know what these aircrafts were do you actually believe that because this is an Army Air Force training base and you may say that these may have been old defunct aircrafts but the fact of the matter is this is an enormous security breach the Air Force is is most important part of any fighting force there is and N terrorists managed to actually get inside this Air Force training camp and then went about damaging airplanes it's just matter of luck that these aircrafts that you now say are old defunct aircrafts and therefore they were damaged anyway so I I I am not going to sit here and condone that yes this is a security left that they should not even have been able to climb the wall using the letter that's what I'm trying to say here I'm not saying that there is no security lap obviously they even if they were defunct aircraft and them to damage that means they have passed through that security protocol or barrier uh that shouldn't have been crossed so there is obviously a reason for soul searching for the Armed Forces for those who are uh uh in charge of Defending That Base however the terrorist what I'm trying to say is the terrorist were not able to go into the inner perimeter they were able only to to cause damage to these deunk aircraft had there been uh had they been able to go inside then they would have been more damag and I agree then they would have been more damaged but the the way the layout is the way the things are they could not go any further and they thought the terrorist because they did not know they thought they have actually created a lot of havoc and created damage right they would have been happy but by then they had been identified or they had been seen or located and they were targeted and they were killed all right all right now uh just just my quick follow-up question is now these terrorists reportedly belong to a new organization that has emerged called the T Jihad Pakistan it's very closely associated with the T Taliban Pakistan which is the Pakistani Taliban wing of the Afghan Taliban now this is a major challenge is it not major for the Pakistani State the Taliban Pakistan has made it abundantly clear their objective is the destruction of the Pakistani State as it exists and they enough increasingly relying more and more on the Strategic depth that they have in Afghanistan to carry this out uh right this is a relatively unknown Group which has now claimed responsibility and it Associates itself with t Taliban Pakistan now I would I would like to uh bring to your attention the uh the timing of this attack or the timing of this and the attack on the 14 soldiers that were martyred uh just a few hours before this happened so these two attacks have happened simultaneously the timing is that on the 1st of November the government of Pakistan says it's going to repatriate all the illegal afans which the reason we say we want to repatriate them is because they say these undocumented afans are involved in actions or activities that we are not happy with and this exactly what you see as a result they are trying to give us a sort of a message all right that we are not happy with your so we were prepared or we knew the government of Pakistan knew that there were going to be there was going to be some backlash right and that's why you find there's not been a um Monumental damage well in terms of the soldiers skill yes 14 lives loss is a huge loss in guad undoubtedly um here in on the PF base uh the damage has not been that much you we we short of time but I want you to quickly comment on an important question that I'm sure will be talked about a lot in the days to come Pakistan wants 1.8 million undocumented afans predominantly pashun living in the kab pakun region to in fact go back into Afghanistan but the fact is this region has got very poorest borders the kab Paka region and the pashun region in Afghanistan are very closely ethnically related for decades these are people who lived in Pakistan they've not known any other Nation apart from Pakistan because they had migrated a long time back but asking all of these un you know documented migrants predominantly pashun to have go back is Pakistan making making the crisis worse for itself now look I I I'll explain this to you when you talk about Forest B yes this was right and this is right uh but we have plugged that Forest border through fencing on The Afghan border however and that is where when you say Taliban providing them the sanctuary the Taliban Afghanistan that's what I have to clarify that the Afghan government continues to say and this is what their commitment to us and to the National Community was when they came into power that they will not let their soil be used for terrorism against any other countries or neighbors however we have been continuously reiterating that they do not have the control over entire Afghanistan and they are only at best controlling cabul and areas close to it right now last year if you remember uh I know you push for time and I'm going to try to sum it up as quick as possible uh the people on the other side of the Pakistani B on the other side of the fence in Afghanistan they actually uh they blasted the wire the the fence and they broke it off and uh it was reported and people said oh the Taliban are involved well the Taliban the local tribesmen MH who uh directly do not sometimes follow the orders of the Afghan government in the center they do things and that's when they also Harbor those people because as for their culture they say we have a guest and we need to take care of the guest and that's the kind of thing that's what has been happening absolutely it's not the afan government but there it's their incapability and that's and the reason is uh you rightly pointed out the the the pashon on both side of afan and the Pakistan side they have friends and families and their marriages and they have relatives across each side so what what Pakistan government has done we have opened the legal Crossing channels right the border crossings the the legal ones from where they can come in and go how however we we have now said that these people as you said that this is going to cause a big crisis well unfortunately it's Pakistan which has been facing this for last 40 years or so so now it's the time for Afghan government to to go and take responsibility for their own people and take care of them I I think I think you're technically giving us what the Pakistani government in fact says officially on this matter but but this is a crisis that is not going to end anytime soon expecting 1.8 million you know Pon afans from it is not going to solve the crisis that Pakistan this moment St but uh major Chan thank you very much indeed for joining us we're completely out of time this is a discussion that I'm pretty sure that we'll continue to have for quite a few weeks to thank you very muched cheers thank Von is now available in your country download the app now and get all

News", "uploader": "DW News", "transcript": "rape is the cheapest and possibly the oldest weapon of War it's also the least condemned and most silenced War crime it's against that backdrop that Israeli rights groups are trying to raise awareness about reports of sexual violence committed by Hamas militants during the October 7th attack this week protesters demonstrated outside the UN office in Jerusalem calling on it to address the issue of violence against women by Hamas some Israeli activists say the un is downplaying the issue the UN says it has requested access to collect information about the attacks but it has not received a response from Israel Christina Lamb is Chief correspondent for the Sunday Times and she's also the author of the book our bodies their Battlefield in which she Chronicles the lives of women in Wartime and how sexual violence against them is used as a weapon Christina so good to see you again you're in Israel at the moment what what have you heard about the sexual violence perpetrated by Hamas on and after October 7th so I've spoken to a number of women's organizations uh and police and others who all say that they have a body of evidence from people largely at the Music Festival on October the 7th um eyewitnesses of women young women being brutally raped gang raped um at the festival and a lot of other atrocities against women how does that compare to what you've been able to document in other attacks and conflicts so I mean the problem here at the moment that is that there no survivors have actually come forward so this is all um information coming either from people who are like First Responders or people who were hiding that day and say that they saw things or also videos that Hamas themselves put out at the time as we know they were kind of live streaming some of the atrocities and also from interrogations from Hamas fighter who have been called so that you know there is quite a a a body of evidence um suggesting that this you know happened um um was systematic uh it unfortunately is something that we see in every conflict there has been widespread criticism of international women's organizations and the UN not responding appropriately to the acts of sexual violence perpet ated on October 7th there have been protests and hashtags like me too unless you're a Jew have been trending why the silence you think I think part of it is that we haven't actually had any survivors come forward and there you know let's be honest there's been a lot of propaganda in this conflict generally so uh you know um there's been a tendency to to doubt a lot of things because quite often things were told at the beginning turn out not to be true um but so that's one of the reasons that I came here to actually you know go and talk to people and try and find out for myself as much as you can what's really happening and certainly you know there are people that were collecting the the bodies and body remains talk about you know clear evidence forensic evidence that women were raped and bruly raped before they were killed I mean in some cases you know so violently that their pelvic bones were broken um so there's a lot of anger here among women's groups that this isn't being taken seriously they think in uh the International Community and the different standard s are being applied um I mean one thing I would say is usually because they're saying that there the International Community puts out statements very quickly about this in other places I'm not sure that that people in Ethiopia for example would agree women there were you know complaining for months that this was happening before anybody said anything if you look at DRC I think the figure is say something like 60,000 women have been raped this year so and nobody's really talking about that so you could argue that you know um this is an issue that doesn't get enough attention generally it's not something specific to to Israel but it you know it is the case that un women in particular have not put out a state they could put out a statement for example expressing their concern at the reports that that doesn't commit them to anything yeah rights groups have been calling for the ICC to investigate the acts of gender based and sexual violence as a crime against humanity now considering everything that you just laid out and that the IC has prosecuted only two cases of rape in over 20 years you know a scenario as chaotic as the October 7th attack no survivors who have identified themselves as victims how hard will it be to establish some sort of accountability well first of all ISRO isn't a member of the IC so that rather complicates things but um and as you point out the IC does not have a great record on this it has an appalling record although the um current chief prosecutor Kar K when he was elected last year one of his pledges was precisely to do something on this issu so here is um a good example um but you know it is very difficult generally to collect evidence on this but there is uh there's two things going on here the police have launched a big investigation and massing evidence and there's also a civilian commission and and both of these I mean it shouldn't be the case that you do actually have to have the women themselves come forward in in order to believe it because this is something often very difficult for people to talk about you know it's the one crime where the victim is often made to feel that they did something wrong sadly you've also tried to find an answer to why this keeps happening have you found an answer I mean it seems clear to me that it's happening more and more and I think one of the reasons the failure of the International Community there is complete impunity sadly rape is a very effective weapon if you want to humiliate your enemy or terrorize them or drive them out of an area and at the moment no one's paying a price for that because almost nobody is brought to Justice interestingly I mean the one sort of bright spot in in all of this in terms of getting Justice is the use of universal jurisdiction which means that any country can prosecute somebody for a war crime anywhere it doesn't have to be in the country where it happened and Germany is actually Pioneer in this because Germany has now um convicted Iraqi man for taking a idi um mother and child and the child actually um was chained up outside and died of thirst that's the first conviction um for what happened to the ucds so that is something a model that other countries could be using those was author and reporter Christina Lamb Chief correspondent for the Sunday Times I highly recommend you read her book our bodies their Battlefield thank you so much for your

IT'S ALWAYS A \"BUT, WE HAVE TO REMEMBER, IT HAPPENS IN WAR.\" \"HOWEVER, WE HAVE TO REMEMBER.\" >> YEAH. TODAY, THE UNITED NATIONS IS GOING TO HOLD A HEARING ON THE SEXUAL AND GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE REPORTED DURING THE ATTACK AND THE SILENCE FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT FOLLOWED. JOINING US NOW, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY AND MSNBC LEGAL ANALYST JOYCE VANCE. DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR NEW YORK'S WESTCHESTER COUNTY, MIMI ROCAH. THEY ARE CO-AUTHORS OF AN OPINION PIECE IN \"SLATE,\" CALLING OUT THE LACK OF INTERNATIONAL OUTRAGE OVER THE REPORTS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE COMMITTED IN THE OCTOBER 7th HAMAS TERROR ATTACKS. A LOT OF IT IS SEEN ON VIDEO AND DOCUMENTED IN VIDEO, OF WOMEN WHO WERE RAPED, KILLED WHILE THEY WERE RAPED, YOUNG GIRLS WHO WERE RAPED. I MEAN, THE EVIDENCE IS CLEAR. YET, MIMI, I'LL START WITH YOU, THERE HAS NOT BEEN A FOCUS ON THIS AS A WAR CRIME OR ON THIS ENOUGH, ACCORDING TO MANY WHO BELIEVE WOMEN ICE RIGHT'S RIGHTS EVEN BEING CONSIDERED HERE. >> YEAH, THANK YOU SO MUCH, JOE AND MIKA, FOR TALKING ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC. I GUESS THE THING I WOULD SAY, GIVEN THE CLIP YOU PLAYED, IS WHY WE DON'T HAVE TO BE BALANCED IN OUR OUTRAGE, WHICH I THINK IS THE PHRASE THAT WAS USED. WE SHOULD NOT BE BALANCED IN OUR OUTRAGE, NOT AGAINST THE PALESTINIANS, BY THE WAY, SHE SAID PALESTINIANS, IT'S AGAINST HAMAS. HAMAS DID THIS ON OCTOBER 7th. WE HAVE TO BE OUTRAGED BECAUSE, FIRST OF ALL, THE GIRLS WHO HAD THEIR PELVIC BONES BROKEN BECAUSE THEY WERE RAPED SO MUCH, WHOSE LEGS WERE BROKEN, WHO WERE SHOT WHILE PEOPLE WERE STILL RAPING THEM, THEY DESERVE US TO BE OUTRAGED, AS ANY WOMAN OF ANY GAC BACKGROUND WOULD. >> YES. >> SECOND, BECAUSE THERE ARE STILL YOUNG WOMEN HOSTAGES, AND WE HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE SOMETHING HORRIBLE MA IY BE HAPPENING TO THEM. WE HAVE TO BE OUTRAGED. THE WHOLE WORLD HAS TO BE OUTRAGED AND DEMAND THEIR RELEASE NOW, JUST AS WE'VE DONE FOR OTHER GIRLS WHO WERE TAKEN CAPTIVE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. FINALLY, MIKA, AND THIS IS THE MOST NUANCED POINT, BUT I HOPE WOMEN EVERYWHERE UNDERSTAND IT, IT'S BECAUSE THIS HURTS WOMEN EVERYWHERE WHEN WE SAY, \"DON'T BELIEVE WHAT YOUR EYES ARE SEEING.\" WHEN WE LET PEOPLE WITH AN AGENDA, LIKE HAMAS MEN, DICTATE WHEN WE BELIEVE RAPE HAPPENED. NO, WE HAVE EVIDENCE HERE. I'M A PROSECUTOR. JOYCE IS A PROSECUTOR. WE LOOK AT THE VIDEO. WE LISTENED TO THE WITNESS TESTIMONY. WE HEAR THE ACCOUNTS OF PEOPLE WHO SAW IT. WE CAN'T LET OTHER PEOPLE TELL US WHEN TO BELIEVE RAPE HAPPENED. IT HAPPENED. WE HAVE TO SUPPORT ALL WOMEN EVERYWHERE. >> JOYCE VANCE, YOUR TAKE, AND WHAT DO YOU THINK NEEDS TO BE DONE? >> SO I THINK, MIKA, THAT MIMI MAKES THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT HERE, AND IT GIVES US THE STARTING POINT GOING FORWARD. THIS IS, AS Y'ALL HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING THIS MORNING, A HOPELESSLY COMPLICATED CRISIS. THE QUESTION IS, WHAT'S THE PATH FORWARD? PERHAPS A SMALL PIECE OF THAT STARTS WITH AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF OUR COMMON HUMANITY. IT'S NOT COMPLICATED TO CONDEMN RAPE. IT SHOULDN'T BE DIFFICULT. OFTEN IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT, IT'S DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO RECONCILE THEIR EMOTIONS. NOW, THE UNITED NATIONS HEARINGS GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO EVALUATE THE EVIDENCE. THAT'S WHAT MIMI AND I DO AS PROSECUTORS. WE'RE USED TO DISCUSSING THE EVIDENCE, EVEN IN THESE HORRIFIC SEXUAL CRIMES, IN A VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD MANNER. THIS WILL BE PAINFUL AND DIFFICULT FOR MANY PEOPLE TO LISTEN TO, BUT THE EVIDENCE, THE EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS, THE ACCOUNTS OF MEDICS AND FIRST RESPOND RESPONDERS ABSOLUTELY CONFIRMS THAT THESE RAPES TOOK PLACE, THAT THEY WERE TORTURE RAPES. NOW, IT IS INCUMBENT UPON WOMEN IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND HERE DOMESTICALLY TO TAKE A MOMENT TO REFLECT AND TO EVALUATE ON WHAT THE EVIDENCE SAYS. THEN WE CAN SPEAK WITH ONE VOICE AND SAY, \"THIS IS WRONG.\" IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT HAPPENS IN WAR. IT CERTAINLY SHOULDN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE THAT THE VICTIMS ARE JEWS AND ISRAELIS. WE CAN CONDEMN THIS AND ACKNOWLEDGE OUR SHARED HUMANITY AND BEGIN TO MOVE FORWARD TO DEAL WITH THE OTHER IMPLICATIONS OF THIS CRISIS. >> MIMI, DURING WORLD WAR II, MILITARY CODE LAW WAS THAT AMERICAN SOLDIERS WHO RAPED A WOMAN COULD BE EXECUTED. THAT ACTUALLY RELAXED A BIT JUST BECAUSE MEN OF COLOR WERE CONVICTED UNFAIRLY, AND EISENHOWER INTERVENED IN A CASE. BY THE TIME WE GOT TO GERMANY, IT WASN'T NECESSARILY THAT AN AMERICAN SOLDIER WOULD GET CONVICTED, AND GEORGE PATTEN WAS INFURIATED. THAT WAS THE ETHOS OF THE U.S. MILITARY DURING THAT WAR. IF ANY AMERICAN SOLDIER RAPED A WOMAN, THEY SHOULD BE EXECUTED. HOW DID WE GET FROM THAT TO TODAY, WHERE YOU HAVE AMERICAN LEADERS TRYING TO EQUIVOCATE HERE? >> I DON'T TOTALLY KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT, BUT MY EDUCATED GUESS OR OPINION IS THAT IT'S ABOUT VICTIM BLAMING. THAT'S WHY I SAY THIS IS SO DANGEROUS TO ALL WOMEN. BECAUSE FOR MANY COMPLICATED REASONS, AS JOYCE SAYS, AND I'M NOT HERE AS AN EXPERT ON FOREIGN RELATIONS OR THE WAR ITSELF OR ANYTHING, I'M HERE ON THIS ONE ISSUE ABOUT WOMEN AND SEXUAL ASSAULT AND BELIEVING VICTIMS AND BELIEVING THE EVIDENCE THAT WE SEE IN FRONT OF OUR EYES. BUT I ALSO AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH VICTIM BLAMING. I MEAN, WE KNOW IT IN THIS COUNTRY FROM \"HER SKIRT WAS TOO SHORT,\" \"SHE DRANK TOO MUCH.\" WE ALL FOUGHT QUITE HARD FOR DECADES TO GET AWAY FROM THAT. THIS FEELS VERY REMINISCENT OF THAT. THE GIRLS AT THE MUSIC FESTIVAL HAD NOTHING -- HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BOMBING THAT'S HAPPENING NOW. YET, WHEN YOU PIVOT FROM, \"YES, RAPE IS BAD, BUT DON'T BOMB GAZA,\" YOU'RE INHERENTLY BLAMING THESE VICTIMS FOR THAT. I THINK THAT IS WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, WITH SOME PEOPLE. I MEAN, THIS IS A GENERALIZATION. IT'S JUST WRONG, AND IT'S DANGEROUS FOR ALL OF US, FOR ALL WOMEN EVERYWHERE. >> JOYCE, WHAT YOU AND MIMI ARE CONCERNED ABOUT, IN PART, IS THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S FAILURE TO CONDEMN THE RAPES. WHAT MORE DO WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THAT? WE WERE TALKING ABOUT, WHAT HAVE THEY FAILED TO DO? >> RIGHT. SO THERE WAS SILENCE FOR A LENGTHY PERIOD OF TIME. THERE WERE EVEN SOME FOLKS WHO SUGGESTED, AS MIMI HAS BEEN DISCUSSING, THAT THE ACCOUNTS OF THESE RAPES WEREN'T CREDIBLE. I THINK, TODAY, THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A RESTART. THE UNITED NATIONS WAS EXTREMELY SLOW TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND CONDEMN THESE RAPES. NOW, WE APPEAR TO BE ON THAT PATH. THESE ARE WAR CRIMES, AND THEY CAN BE PROSECUTED AS SUCH. IT'S ALSO A POSSIBILITY, QUITE FRANKLY, THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT COULD ENGAGE ON THE TOPIC OF AMERICAN WOMEN WHO WERE KIDNAPPED AND RAPED, AND THERE COULD BE PROSECUTIONS. ISRAELI LAW ON CONSPIRACY IS DIFFERENT THAN OUR LAW IN THE UNITED STATES. IT'S MORE DEMANDING AND RESTRICTIVE IN TERMS OF THE NEED TO SPECIFICALLY SHOW AN AGREEMENT THAT ENCOMPASSED, AN AGREEMENT THAT ISRAELI WOMEN WOULD BE RAPED AS PART OF THIS OPERATION. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT INDICATES THAT THERE WAS PREPARATION AND ADVANCED PLANNING, INCLUDING LINGUISTIC HELP. PEOPLE BEING TOLD HOW TO SPEAK ISRAELI TO TELL WOMEN TO PULL DOWN THEIR PANTS. THERE HAS BEEN SOME TESTIMONY FROM PEOPLE WHO WERE INVOLVED ON THE HAMAS SIDE THAT THERE WAS, PERHAPS, A RELIGIOUS WAIVER THAT PERMITTED THEM TO VIOLATE TRADITIONAL MUSLIM DICTATES AGAINST RAPE. ALL OF THIS DESERVES EXAMINATION AND JUTE NYSCRUTINY. REALLY, IT DEMANDS IT. AS MIMI SAID, IF WOMEN AREN'T SAFE IN ISRAEL, WOMEN AREN'T SAFE ANYWHERE. IF WE CAN USE JUSTIFICATIONS TO BLAME INDIVIDUAL VICTIMS, YOUNG WOMEN WHO WERE ASLEEP IN A KIBBUTZ, AND HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, IN SOME CASES, TEENAGE GIRLS AND YOUNGER. IF WE CAN BLAME WOMEN WHO WERE ATTENDING A CONCERT FOR THE POLICYIES OF A NATION THAT THEY MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE SUPPORTED, AND USE IT TO JUSTIFY RAPE, WOMEN ARE NOT SAFE ANYWHERE. WE NEED TO BEGIN TO SPEAK OUT MORE STRONGLY THAN WE HAVE UP"}, "EW0Atcdy38g": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW0Atcdy38g", "video_id": "EW0Atcdy38g", "description": "WARNING: This story contains distressing details.

Israeli Defense Forces held a special briefing for foreign journalists the presentation included never-before seen footage from the October 7th attack and it was taken from body cameras worn by Hamas militants one Canadian journalist who saw the film is Graham wood of the Atlantic and joins me now and Graham just I want to pause for a second here because I want to give our viewers a second because a lot of what you're going to tell us is very graphic I read about it it's horrific um and it's going to be difficult to hear so first of all the footage you saw as I mentioned violently graphic can you walk through some of that with us yeah so it was about 43 minutes long and I will spare you some of the details I I hope to be spared over seeing it again myself um but what you saw was uh number of people uh victims Israelis um as well as guest workers um from Thailand and elsewhere um in the beginning of the footage they're Alive by the end they're dead sometimes um in fact frequently after their death their their bodies are still being desecrated um and over the course of that that time you you you see an incredible gamlet of Cruelty um it comes from Hamas body cameras it also comes from um home cameras like nanny cams uh and it comes from um uh some of the uh images from First Response ERS um there's just an incredible range of of of things that were done uh that um uh really demonstrated a sadistic urge um and I like I say I I hope I hope I never have to see it again yeah I mean it's important that the journalists saw this too and for you you know is there something that I guess it's important that that you see it because you have to tell the story still so how do you tell that story yeah I mean a lot of the people in that room were seasoned War reporters are people who are familiar with with seeing horrible things so I think a lot of us were much more prepared for it than than others um you know I've reported on Isis in the past for example um and many of these things were were comparable the the sheer volume of it was um was pretty horrifying and the best that I could do is to try to describe um in words uh for My article in the Atlantic some of the things that that um really you know they they they break your heart and and they they they question your faith and Humanity so um it was that that's what I did over the course of of of my piece how did you I mean we know how you reacted to this and it's really really tough other reporters in the room how did they react after and how many were there actually I would say there was about 100 reporters um I think almost everybody had a a visceral response I you couldn't have anything else other than a visceral response to this um and uh the questions afterward um there were there were people asking you know what became of some of the people we didn't see die uh we saw children who were covered in blood uh who were blinded uh who had lost their parents and uh you know this is this is this is really horrible stuff um and um there is human concern um there is also practical concern I mean this is a screening by one side in the conflict and so people certainly wanted to know uh where did this come from what else haven't we seen um you know what have you spared us uh what else what else is out there um but that there were many reasonable and professional questions that were asked of the Israel Defense Forces after they showed this to us can you answer any of those questions like maybe your biggest question coming out of that uh did you get it answered I mean honestly the questions that I had were existential I mean they were about men's Humanity to to man The the inhumanity to man The the fate of the the children was one of the first questions that was asked in the IDS they couldn't answer that question and in fact much of that footage it's not clear that the families have seen it which is one reason we were not allowed to uh to have the footage ourselves um but you know what you you see horrible things happening you also hear at one point a phone call from one of the Hamas Fighters terrorists to his family back home and uh it to me one of the most upsetting things was was to hear what that conversation sounded like that the enthusiasm in his voice and the slight enthusiasm but also confusion I think on the part part of his his parents uh to whom this man was saying uh you know put on Mom I'm a hero I I killed 10 Jews with my own hands um and uh to to think about how many ways that this conflict um this terrorist act uh has destroyed lives um and in including um really turning the perpetrators themselves into such debased people um that it whatever thinks about the the conflict as a whole um anybody who's associated with with with those people has been um diminished um and no one less than the perpetrators themselves can you talk about the reason why the Israeli government wanted journalist to see this footage um I can tell you why they said they wanted us to see the footage um which was they said um Mickey adelstein who's a major general in the idea said you know it's not a normal thing thing for the IDF to have a 43 minute screening of Jews being killed uh in one of its auditoriums for journalists um but I he said that that Israel's been um sort of at a loss because of the um the uh the the way that they've been treated as um equal to Hamas and he said look if if you see what's happening here um children are being hunted down and killed um there are old people who are hunted down and killed I mean like running through a village trying to find them and then killing them and then continuing to shoot them after their death and he said Israel doesn't do that if if it is there are of course civilians who die as a result of what Israel does but Ren doing that and he said that it was very important for for them to to point out that this is the level of Cruelty of the enemy that they face and that's that's why they're so shocked arked um by the comparisons they're sometimes made let me just ask you as a seasoned War journalist how you know you have to see horrific things how do you cope after something like this too because I've read a lot of this even reading some of the descriptions are just unfathomable yeah I mean it's it's it's painful for me I'm a human being um yeah War journalists though uh no one forces us to do this job and there are other jobs too where you see horrible things I mean uh trauma nurses for example um it there there are professions where this is this is part of the work and um I do think it's important that anybody does a kind of work like this knows that it's coming um and uh tries to tries to to know the limit um when you sit down in an auditorium and you know the lights go down and you start

We're talking about  the latest  as  Israel  is   at  war with  Hamas.   So we know this all began  with  that  surprise, attack   by  Hamas.  October 7th on   Israel, Hundreds  killed  or   wounded in  that attack.  at   the Nova  Festival  Hilly.   Solomon was among those  victims murdered  and her  sister  Tao joins us  live.  Now to talk talk  more. about  her sister  here. Thank you  so  much  towel for  taking the  time  to  join   us. Thank you for having  me.  first off,  Can you start by   telling me  about your   sister  hilly?  We  were   looking at  photos. yesterday  and you were telling  me   some  people  did mistake you  for twins.  Yes.  that   unfortunately,  for twins.   Yes, that unfortunately is   the truth.  Unfortunately,   not because of  anything   besides the fact  that  she  was simply  a force that  I'm  still struggling  to   understand  how was no   longer  a part of my  life.  So  I would like  to  ask for  forgiveness.  forgiveness.   in advance in case  I refer  to  her in present tense   because I'm still dealing  with  the fact  that  she is.  in fact gone. really  was  a beautiful funny smart and  Incredibly  caring   person. She she was 26  years  old and two weeks shy of   her.  27th  birthday. but she  was mature  Beyond  her  years.  She was raised  in   Israel  and in  Hong Kong.   we  grew  up  moving  from   one place to  alot  because  of  my  father's  job.  And  that  only  brought us   closer  only  And so  we   saw it a sense of community.   one might say we  found  comfort in  each  other and  she was my  best  friend   first,  and foremost  before.  anything  else  before  she  was my  blood relative  in my  sister. and she she was a  force He, she dedicated  her life  to  making  others   feel  welcome.  loved.   Beautiful.  and unique   through a small business, but  she And she wanted  people.  regardless  of  their  ethnicity.  of  their gender,  their sexual. orientation to   love  who they  were, That   was her life's Mission  And  she sent  such  high  goals  for herself.  she had high   ambitions.  and she wanted   to  shout her every glass  ceiling.  and she had her  entire  life  ahead of  her.   And that  was that's   what's most heartbreaking  about all of  this. What  is   your  understanding?  of   what? happened  to  her?  and  the other people  that  were   there at the  Nova Music   Festival? so, from  my   understanding,  the last   time  I saw her face  to face  was Friday  night.  She  wasn't  meant to  go  to the   Festival. This  was a  last minute decision.  but that's entirely.   who she is  as  a person. She  wanted  to conquer  the world  and sees  whatever.  opportunities life  brought  her.  She called  me  around   7:40  a.m.  on  Saturday   morning.  and that's  when   she shared  that  an hour  earlier.  missiles  were   fired in  the direction of   the And that  she could see  she from  the sky.  The  festival  was aborted.   suddenly  then   and that all the people that   attended  the festival   didn't  understand  what was   happening.  And so  her and  her two friends,  that   accompanied her,  they  made   their way.  towards their car  and they  started driving  away  from  the festival  and  heading towards home. But  shortly after they entered   the car,  a police car. waved  frantically for all the cars   to turn Towards where they   were  driving from  from  the  festival. And that's  when   she and her friends saw.   Vehicles  packed  with  armed  Hamas.  terrorists. heading  straight  towards them  and  starting  shooting. everyone   in  their way.  they? had to   abandon their car?  just   like  everyone  else  and run  for their lives.  in the   forest. and my  sister then.   said  that  there were   people  that  were  injured.   that  were  splattered   across  the road. There were   bodies  of  casualties   across  the field.  and she  said  that  she had a  low battery and so  I told   her to  save  whatever   battery she had left  and to   stay in touch.  It  was still  at  this  point where we  had  no  idea  the extent of the  severity  of  what  was  unraveling. I told. Her to   call  me  back  and update   me  and of  course  come   over. to  my  house.  so   that  she could rest  to   after running away  from   from  whatever  it was. that   was chasing after them. Now,   I understand  how ridiculous   that  was.  She called  me   back  about  30 minutes after that.  And  she sounded much  that. She  was hyperventilating. and  vomiting  in the  middle  of   the panic attack. She said   It  felt  as though,  she was  in the  Holocaust.  that  she  was running in the  field.   hiding  from  people  who  were  shooting  out her  And then  at this point I  could hear  all the shooting   in  the background  She said   that  she could hear  them   getting closer  and that  she  didn't  know  what  to  do.  Then you  could  hear the fear.   Fear in her voice.  She  told me that  she loved me.  and I told  her that  I  loved her too.  I don't know   if  you've heard  that. that   was Iron Dome.  Just  now,   that  was my  dog barking  because Iron Dome just   stopped.  and the cell from  and airing  right above our  heads.  in Tel Aviv.   shelter.  Let me  know.  Thank you.  I am  this   is the  reality that we have   to  deal  with. and so  the  most important  thing is   that my sister  told me that   she loved me  and I told her   that  I loved her too.  and  that  I'll  see her soon. and  that  was the last  time   that  we  ever spoke.  I later,  found out.  through  her friend, what  had  happened  to  her?  that   after our conversation? she  was in the  middle  of the   panic attack  and she  couldn't  run anymore.   A grenade was thrown   in there. Way.  And so  her  friend  had to  physically   pick  her up. and run towards  the vehicle.  where they   were  hiding  underneath.  they  laid  their pretending   to  be  dead. Motionless. and  just  praying for someone  to come and rescue  them. and  it  was at that point that   Hamas terrorists  came. and  ensured that they were, in   fact, dead. then shot them.  And that's how  she met her  death.  is by hiding   unarmed.  hopeless. Alone.   just  scared  for her life.  And that  was the last  time.  I Ever  spoke to  her.  And  that was  the last  I heard.   of  what  happened  to her,  Several families  have  said   that  there was a lot of   confusion at  first,  they   were  told  different things   about what  happened  to   their family. members.  what   hospitals they  were  in  Was  that  your  experience? as   well, Or  that  you know   at that point?  that  your   sister  had been  taken from   you.  confusion is  an,  as a huge understatement  we   scouted.  hospital  beds   trying  to  find  my sister.   We  showed  her birth marks  and Tattoos to  nurses.  Begging them  to  look  again  inside. surgery rooms,   just in case  they've seen   her,  but they  were  unaware  because maybe she came  in   and and,  and for some   reason  was unconscious,   this  was still when  we   didn't  know  what   had happened  to her. And to   this  day,  we  still  don't know  when  she was  pulled  away  from  the scene  where she was injured or   she was found.   Sound. I know bought   of families that  found their  loved ones. were  murdered   because the Hamas.  posted   videos  of  their death on   social  media on  their own,   the murdered  people's   Facebook  accounts. they   took  their phones. and  livestream, third death.  I  I'm also familiar with   people  who have  found out  that  their loved ones  were   taken hostage.  via social   media as well.  There's a lot  that  we  don't know, but  what's  most  important,   right now,  is  for us   to get  her hostages  back   to get  people  back  to   their home. So  while we   would love  to  know  what   happened  to my little   sister, and we  have  so many  questions in our   mind. Still,  what's  most   important?  is that we  get  our people  back  home  safe.  I was just  thinking about,  what you  had said  about the  Iron Dome when  you hear   those.  missiles  being  intercepted by  it.  what what is that?  like   because right now that  is   kind  of  day-to-day  life   for you.  It's  almost   an everyday occurrence  as   you mentioned.  what  goes   through your  mind  when   you are hearing that  sound  because obviously you know   exactly what  that  sound is.  sound is. Unfortunately,   it's  something that  we've  grown accustomed  to  as   horrible  as  it  sounds   This  is  our reality.  This   is  something that  we've  been  screaming from the  top  of  our lungs.  for years  now.  is  the fact that we   are dealing with. terrorists.  Who would like  nothing more   than  to  see us  completely   getting rid of  not just from  this  country.  not just   from  this  land. But from   this  world,  and we've been   seeing  such  atrocities  of   what's been happening,   to people all around  us.  That  At  it's so ridiculous   to  say that  the missiles   quite that  right above my   head  at any given  moment.  are the least of our  issues.  I've  seen  videos  of   decapitated babies  and  burned  family  members and  executed, elderly and  Holocaust.  Survivors.  We've  seen  such  atrocities  that   this  doesn't even  begin to   explain what  we  have  to   deal  with  on  a daily.   basis.  simply  for existing   my  last  question  for you  here, you've seen a lot of   the videos  you're   looking at  it  right now.   live  in  Gaza.  You're obviously. over  in   Israel  as  everything. is   continuing  here. to the   pictures  the videos. So they  really  capture the severity   of  what  you're  dealing  with. Because you can only   show  so  much. in  these  images. I in these images.   to  be  so  different  to actually be  there and see  this  firsthand.  unfolding  right there before  your   eyes. I don't know  what   videos  and photos. are  allowed to  even  be  aired  on. public television.  but I  can assure you  that   everything  that  has been   seen  even  what has been  seen  by  the dark  web?  It   is  just  a fraction. of   what  we  know. There are  still hostages  being  tortured  to  this  very   moment. and they're going  through unimaginable, things,  things  that  they'll never  be  able  to  recover from.  and using social  media,  to   both  celebrate these in.  Humane  acts of Terror. And  while attempting  to  evoke  the world.  Sympathy. that's   something that  is. It's not.  Humane  by any  Humane  It's   monstrous and I think that   there are a lot of  things   that  need to be   taken into consideration.  when  it  comes to  war.   first.  and foremost  is  who  is  on either sides.  and  when  you come  to  think of   how this  all began it  began  with  a terror attack,  on   innocent  civilians,  who did  nothing all they did. was  celebrated  Jewish  holiday  finish  it  with  a Full of  peace.  and the people  who  were  the civilians who were   living  in the  nearby, small  towns there were  enjoying   their Shabbat,   their Saturday's  our weekend  just  like  everyone  else.  There were  getting up   in the  morning.  they   mapped  out their day  they were planning   to have breakfast with  their  children. The things  that   they  had to  that  one of   the most  hideous stories  that  I've  personally   heard.  and seen  on   the muses that  a teen  the  child was pulled  away  from   his family. while he  was in   his home. And he  was asked  to go knocking  on  different  sheltered doors.  and asking   different.  Israelis  to   open up the door. he  was  begging them  to  open  them   because he  had a gun to his   head  at that point.  and he   knew  that  his  family would die and  Unless   he  would beg those out of   their families  in  Hebrew.  to  open  their doors.  and  to  let him in, And of   course  he  couldn't  expose   the fact that there was a  terrorist standing  right  behind  him and as  those  doors were  shut  open.  everyone  in  those shelters   died. So  they're using us.  against our own.  Who does   that  Whoo. us  against our  own,  who does that?  Who  would have  we  come  to?  What  is  this  world come   to  that? This  is  what  we   have  to  protect ourselves  from  Hamas.  Has Isis  in   every in  every single  way,   but it's  something that  I  genuinely hope  the world  will, finally come to realize  and we've seen  the support.   You've  seen  the global   support that  we've been   receiving. And  it's   something that we hold   dear to our hearts and it lets usBelieve that  we are  doing  the right thing and trying to  protect the world from   these.  hideous Act.

recorded during the October 7th Massacre Israel had hesitated to release this footage thus far but now seeing the narrative around the world and the pressure building on Israel the government decided it needs to put out that information to remind the world about the barbarities that been perpetrated by Hamas terrorists on the Israeli people on October the 7th International journalists here in Israel were invited to a big screening where they saw without their phones without any recording equipment what those body cams of those terrorists actually saw take a look at this report the Camas as we work to defeat the terror organization that brutalized our people we are witnessing a holocaust denial like phenomenon evolving in real time Hamas terrorists went on a Killing Frenzy as the October 7th Siege unfolded this video shows Hamas seek out an in the kibuts in southern Israel Bears Testament to the true horrors of Hamas this was probably a preschool for kids the Doodles and paintings on walls now covered by Bullet marks so uh this isn't the replica this is an actual uh rocket that has been recovered after a particular attack obviously we're told that we can't touch any of the rockets that land here in stot because U there are booby traps many of them are misfired Rockets so they may not have exploded uh but this is actually what it looks like it's a pretty heavy thing uh many such um you know many such debris are already there uh and are part of Investigation but this kind of knowhow uh you know you can see the tail fins you can see the booster module uh you know the the very thick metallic fabrication shows that the Hamas has been able to Garner this kind of no house sitting inside Gaza they do get Rocket uh technology from Iran as well but the know how to convert everyday metal tubes from pipes Etc into usable rockets that have rought so much Devastation uh is a is a matter of great concern especially since Hamas is able to make these kinds of rockets sitting inside Gaza using sending Alka some Rockets still into Israel the big Focus continues to remain the 200 uh 200 hostages that uh are still inside the Gaza Strip in the Captivity of the Hamas so they're all uh you know perhaps in some of the buildings that you can see in these pictures we don't know are they in the north are they in the South there is no idea uh the fact that two hostages were released has actually piled on the tension and suspense over what's going to really happen because the big question continues to be if this is Phase 1 what is Phase 2 and phase history going to look like are negotiations really happening where the non-military hostages from Gaza will all be released very quickly we don't know just yet but in the interim at least while that attains a semblance of clarity Israel is not backing off not even an inch not even for a minute we're reporting now from kibuts Berry uh which is one of the closest agricultural communes to the Gaza Strip uh this uh is a kibutz where the destruction is not only apparent but the void that's been left behind is particularly uh devastating over a 100 people were massacred uh by the Hamas right here at this particular kibuts the destruction is very very plain to see but worse than that over a 100 hostages were taken from just this one kibuts which means that over 100 of uh 200 plus hostages that are currently in Gaza in the captain AC ity of the Hamas terrorist group are from this kibuts alone uh the destruction is not just in terms of you know the little pieces of houses that you can see here but the damage has been devastating uh pretty much throughout the kots uh lots of farms and Fields have been destroyed as a result of Rocket fire uh as you can see huge amount of structural damage to all of the structures here at this particular kibuts uh and as we continue to report here uh the Israel army has uh completely come in and taken over they've got tanks stationed outside they've got a lot of personnel uh deployed here who are uh obviously uh going to be here uh none of the people who survived obviously are still at this kibuts but uh hopefully they will make their way back at some point of time but uh it's just destruction as far as the eye can see in kibot Perry actually took another step which is also very interesting and serves as a kind of precursor to what's going to happen today they invited International journalists to the uh the world-renowned forensic laboratory here in Israel to inspect for themselves the postmortem reports and some of the remains there were small bags of body parts some of them actually got a chance to see slides uh you know of those parts removed so they actually got to see what happened to hundreds of these Israelis who were butchered on October the 7th so it creates a moood it creates a narrative it puts the facts on the ground Israel has so far held back on releasing too much information about what happened on October the 7th but now it believes that the international pressure has gotten a little too much even President Biden has been repeatedly cautioning about what's happening in Gaza he's released uh you know Aid into Palestine he's talked about a two-state solution so Israel believes even though it has its allies international support for more violence in is running a little thin and that's why it needs to create a case and by putting out these shocking unbridled uncensored pictures it believes the world will once again be reminded of what happened on October the 7th and therefore a mood could be created to support what's coming next India's number one political reporter defines what seems to be happening Vendetta politics unmatched die unmatched experience the world has changed my black hair has become

Hamas statement that has just been put out and so I'm glad that I'm talking to you because I'd like to read it together and then get your uh reaction to it here is the statement Hamas has rejected allegations that it committed uh crimes against women and children these are this is the quote some Western media Outlets continue to spread Zionist slander and lies about our Palestinian people in their resistance which falsely and slanderously promoted allegations that members of the Palestinian resistance beheaded children and assaulted women without any evidence to support their lies and claims Hamas strongly condemns the baseless allegations Maran let's let's talk a little bit about this um this is significant because those um those AC accusations are something that have grown louder and louder over the last few days um now Hamas is clearly owning up to the fact that it killed deliberately killed um hundreds and hundreds of Israelis but it seems they're saying there's a red line and that we did not do okay so let's start with the the latter part there is no doubt according again to the two Scholars we just heard on inside story that isra that Hamas Hamas is in breach of inter interational humanitarian law that the way it it took its action uh in Black Saturday against Israeli civilians and so on so forth is in breach of international law there is no doubt about that and it could be defined as a terrorist act did it be HD children and rape women and so on so forth no because the news that first came out from the Los Angeles Times have already been retracted so now it's just being uh you know used as uh as fake information on the web and of course as you know the web especially under mosque you never know you know how how how it will multiply and mutate throughout the world but clearly there was no beheading of children and there is no such thing but I think those who are trying to make the case for land Invasion and for the anation not only of Hamas of the or even of the Palestinian people as animals they are the ones who are already equating the you know 710 with 911 right they're saying that what happened to Israel is 911 and Hamas is like alqaeda and Hamas beads children and Hamas is trying to be slick like Isis and Hamas hates the Jews and as Biden said its sole reason for existence is to kill Jews so already there is a demonizing process by Israel and its pundits and its NE conservative allies in the United States and elsewhere to make the case for repeat of to the 2003 war or the 2011 invasion of Afghanistan basically saying that Hamas is something like the United States has already experience and we know what the results is and hence there is no diplomacy or peace with Hamas Hamas has to be dismantled and it has to be defeated and it has to be ended that kind of comparison is first of all wrong second it is sensationalist and third it will lead to the wrong decisions because Hamas unlike alqaeda unlike Isis and so on so forth had a very particular nationalist agenda and it never acted outside of the borders of Palestine it didn't doesn't have an international agenda Hamas has always functioned within the parameters of historic Palestine and even though it did take actions that are certainly could be defined as terrorist actions this is a nationalist movement that used unsavory tactics but they always stayed within the logic of resistance against what they call their occupiers of the past 55 years and Marwan I think I think this is a really interesting and important point because Hamas has not spoken that much since the beginning of this War and what they have said their statements so far um have been about military things um the the bombardment of Gaza uh they publicly said that they would start killing um people that they're holding captive if uh targets civilian Targets in Gaza were hit without prior warning that has been their communication so far this statement the one that I just read you and that you've been talking about tells us one very very simple thing in addition to everything you've just said that Hamas cares about its Public Image yes they have killed hundreds of people and they clearly own up to that they're not denying it um and they have claimed responsibility for that attack there is zero doubt about that but they care about their Public Image absolutely um you know this is a nationalist movement that Pride itself of being uh you know the protector of its people the representative of its people let's not forget that back in 2006 they won the legislative elections and uh they have remained popular although they're not as popular in Gaza but they are more popular in the West Bank so the fact that their leaders have sacrificed once and again and they spend uh decades in jail uh it's still appreciated by a certain segment of the Palestinian people I'm not sure all Palestinian people support the action of last weekend I'm not sure how many do we haven't conducted any surveys but I'll tell you what it is in the eyes of Hamas and its supporters this was a collective suicide attack because all 14500 Hamas Fighters that went in did not leave right they all been killed so this is in so many ways a collective suicide attack that took with them more than a thousand Israel or a thousand Israelis which is all in by itself is is just of course horrific and tragic but in the end of the day they have not bombed Israel from from the air they have not stayed safe these people sacrificed their lives to kill civilians and soldiers and so on so forth so they are involved on logic gorilla logic a symmetrical Warfare logic of resistance against occupation and they've said for years we've tried other ways and means they did not work and according to them they are this they are left with no other option but to resist Israel with uh you know with with force with violence they took that decisions and now they're taking the responsibility for it unfortunately a lot of people in Gaza in addition to those in Israel are paying the price and I think as you and I were speaking before blink um you know went on air that the predictions about hundreds of thousands perhaps uh tens of thousands perhaps hundred thousands of casual of deaths in Gaza of course is something that we all in this world must stop uh must try to stop anywhere and to to to the last point about just before I forget which is the point about uh safe passage right because this again goes to your point on about Hamas I'm not sure what do they mean by safe patches so they're gonna what let out uh a million gazin into the Sinai where they going to go in the Sinai what are they going to do in the I mean what are you going to do exactly like ship out a million people to where Cairo and and what what guarantees that they will be able to go back because the entire tragedy of this called Palestine started with the idea that Israelis threw them out and when they won't let them back in so what guarantees as soon as you make a safe passage is that these Palestinians will be allowed to come back not to their homes but to their alternative refugee camps and and and Villages and so on and so forth in Gaza second I'm not sure Hamas is going to allow it because it's afraid of exactly that expulsion this will be a safe passage right but it's a pretext to expulsion because that's what Israel does it wants to ship as many people as possible and third no one in Palestine including the Palestinian Authority and Hamas do not want to make uh Israel's job easier for the Israeli Army right because now it's not exactly that they're hiding behind civilian population they are part of the civilian population this is not a professional army they are the young men and women of Gaza and they are fighting occupation so their parents and grandparents and cousins of of these Fighters and so they live there right so that's their families there that's what makes this conflict this asymmetrical conflict so complicated and so tragic and Israel knows that and that's why we keep talking about the fact that there is no military solution to this even Hamas once it's destroyed militarily and administratively how they going to destroy the idea of Hamas the idea of Hamas is apparently more popular in the West Bank and in the Palestinian Refuge camps then it is in Gaza and once you destroy Hamas how are you going to destroy that idea of Hamas in Gaza which is the idea of resistance until Justice is attained Nam"}, "nDn10nDnk_k": {"url":

then that's what they capture her sir do you have any indication why Judith and Natalie they are the first why them on this day I have no idea there were reports that it was a humanitarian effort that Judith um you know wasn't in good health have you gotten any information along those lines she got a scratch in her hand but there was something very minor so nothing to those you aware of have you had those moments where you think like how to some degree lucky that must feel like sort of why me when there are so many other families who would anything I think it's just metal of luck I have no idea have they been reunited with any family there or just with the IDF and in their hands just with the IDF do you know if they were kept together when they were I think so I'm not positive have you been in touch with other families I've been with touch with one grandmother that her son is held captured she live close by and we've been talking for a couple times and be praying for the returns sir do you know where they are right now are they at the US Embassy or are they with the Israelis they are with Israelis yes would you give what message would you send to another host's family just to keep praying and hope for the best do you know where Natalie and her mom are now no I do not know you have other family in Israel and are I have other family in Israel I have two sisters and cousins and I do have other families thank you I thank you very very much thank you thank you sorry we have been listening to the father of Natalie renan Yuri renan calling today the best day of his life knowing that his daughter and her mother Judith were set free from Hamas and taken to Israel you were also hearing from several family members who echoed that sentiment saying just how thankful they are that both of them are safe now the father's saying that he spoke to his star just for a few minutes but already relieved to know that she sounded good he said she looked good and she was ready to come home this happening just a mere 5 days before her birthday October 24th which he says that he hopes to celebrate with her their intentions are for Natalie and her mother to fly home to this area to the Chicago area soon and they hope to see them next week now we did confirm with the father that she was in Israel to celebrate the holiday but also to celebrate the birthday of her grandmother

that they are set free now the father did say that he first learned about this because he saw pictures coming out of Israel and then received a call from IDF Israel Defense Forces confirming that we also learned that the Red Cross played an instrumental role in this they received medical exams from them and they also helped get them from Gaza to Israel and as Natalie's father said Judith seemed to be in good shape as well we'll learn more of course but only hearing that she had a scratch on her hand now coming up tonight at 10: we will have more information from Natalie's brother Ben Ben

Emergency Shelters have been damaged by the latest Israeli air strikes with at least 24 people killed tww special correspondent AIA Ibrahim is in Jerusalem and I asked her for an update on Israel's offensive in Gaza well it's just important to remind our viewers Nicole that we the international press are not allowed inside the Gaza Strip at the moment so any information that we have is information that we have from the IDF or other sources and what they have told us so far is that Israeli soldiers have now encircled God Gaza uh City that's really the heart of the Gaza Strip it's in the northern part of the strip the part that uh Israeli forces have been asking civilians to evacuate from to the South but we do know that not everyone has evacuated either uh they are unwilling or uh unable uh but Israeli forces say they believe that that northern part in in Gaza City and around Gaza City is where a large concentration of Hamas Fighters are to be found we know also that 18 Israeli soldiers have been killed in the fighting since the beginning of the ground Invasion so at least 18 uh soldiers in addition of course to others who have been killed uh since this War uh began we also know from uh uh um the Hamas run Health Ministry in Gaza that a uh un run School uh near the jabala refugee camp that refugee camp camp that has recently uh been struck uh we know that a school around that camp has been struck as well and at least 27 uh people have been killed that's again according to the um to the health Ministry in Gaza and the strip is run uh uh by uh Hamas and so it is U it is you know it is changing every minute but that is the info that we have from both sides so far yeah and a there are reports again today of rising violence in the occupied West Bank with three Palestinians and one Israeli killed throughout the day let's take a look at the situation there and then get back to you Rescuers rushed to the scene after an Israeli reservist was shot dead on his way back to his settlement home for Palestinians living close by the consequences were Swift and familiar Israeli settlers stormed their Village setting buildings of Blaze it's just the latest outbreak of violence in the West Bank where clashes between between settlers and Palestinians have soared since hamas's terrorist attacks many Palestinians feel like they're being forced out of their homes like in this Village close to heon where locals say attacks by settlers have only gotten worse in recent weeks we used to have problems with them but after the war in Gaza they want to kill all of us After the War Began the situation changed they started attacking our houses and the people inside them the Israeli Army has also become increasingly active in the West Bank since October 7th drastically ramping up its raids with Israeli forces detaining hundreds of Palestinians over alleged terrorist links clashes have broken out frequently often with deadly consequences for the Palestinians dozens of people have been killed according to the Palestinian Health Ministry but with all eyes on Gaza the record violence in the West Bank is at risk of being overlooked a how much of a sense is there that the war in Gaza is spilling over into the West Bank as we heard in that report there really is a sense that with all eyes on what's going on in Gaza because of the severity of the situation there uh settlers in the West Bank may be taking advantage of that situation so according to the un uh settler violence which was already at a record high last year has increased this year from an average of three incidents per day to seven incidents per day and so we're hearing reports of harassment violence and at times uh forced evictions if you will as Palestinians feel that it is no longer safe for them to stay in their homes both the both Germany and the United United States have warned against this and have called on the Israeli government to protect Palestinians living in the West Bank now US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin will be in Israel on Friday what can we expect this will be his third visit to Israel and his second to the region since the War uh began and since the terror attacks on October uh 7th we can expect that the messaging from the Secretary of State will remain the same from what it was at the since the beginning of the war which is that the United States stands by Israel stands by Israel's right uh to defend itself but what we will perhaps be hearing more of is the United States calling on Israel to uh take civilian lives more into account that is a demand that we've heard uh more and more increasingly from the Biden Administration as you know this war enters into its third week and as everyday picture of the constant air strikes on Gaza are reaching uh the world we can expect that there will be an emphasis on the importance of protecting civilian lives uh in uh Gaza the secretary of state will also be going to Jordan after that our viewers may remember that when US President Biden was set to visit uh uh Jordan some of the meetings were cancelled because of the incident uh uh explosion at alah hospital so this is again another uh attempt by the administration to try and find a regional solution to this tomorrow we also know that the head of hasah hassanah will be speaking and so this might also this visit might also be looked at as um as a sense as as as deterrence as the Administration has emphasized time and time again that Regional power re Regional uh uh player should not take advantage of the current situation that was a Ibrahim and Jerusalem thanks for that hundreds more foreign passport holders have left Gaza through the Rafa Crossing into Egypt crowds have gathered at the border but only those on an official list are being allowed to pass the biggest group of around 400 were US citizens today the crossing has been open for the first time since the start of the current conflict between Israel and Hamas desperate to get out of Gaza the rough for border crossing is the only Escape for these families many have been at this bus terminal for hours waiting to have their documents approved and be allowed to board the next bus heading across the border into Egypt I have an American passport my daughter has one too my husband submitted his papers but he still didn't get his passport I'm pregnant how am I supposed to get out without my husband I appeal to anyone I want to get out with my husband and my daughter and I don't know what's going to happen and just about an hour ago you heard it probably a aom came down almost explode everything and I have hard condition you know guy [Music] could so I don't know what's going to happen I'm just the other side several hundred Jew nationality Palestinians foreign National and critically injured Garin have crossed the border Egyptian officials say they will assist around 7,000 people to leave but the process may take weeks we do not have any information regarding the opening of The Crossing in the coming days our operations are being managed on a day-to-day basis we sincerely hope that our Egyptian Brothers will keep the crossing open on a continuous basis especially for those who are severely wounded we have approximately 20,000 injured individuals with thousands of them in critical condition ambulances waiting at the Crossing rushed severely injured Palestinians to Egyptian hospitals with more than a third of hospitals in Gaza not operating at all many more people need urgent care but Egypt remains firm that its medical evacuations will be temporary with no Mass Exodus from Gaza and we can speak now to hea TV she's the country director for the NGO care in the Palestinian territories and joins us from rala and the West Bank hea good to see you now some Aid has been delivered through the ga to the Gaza Strip through the Rafa Crossing we saw there do you know at all how many Gins can benefit from it um thank you so much for for this question I think that over the last days we have he the estimations by the UN on the necessity of constant and bigger numbers much bigger numbers hundreds of trucks on daily basis to uh be able to secure the requirements for the mass uh population that is affected but unfortunately uh the number of trucks that entered is very limited it it of course serves it it is very welcome to serve the the people but the number stays at a very very low and minimal number in the same time f is still not on the on the list for which is very important at least to cover the needs in the hospitals and water yeah your organization has published a report on how specifically women and children are affected by the war what did you find so uh everyone is affected by the war but then there are layers of vulnerabilities that are added for women who women who are pregnant women who are household heading heading the household uh women with disabilities with hearing disabilities with physical disabilities and definitely the children and of course the newborns so the different ages they have and the different groups of women and children they are affected more severely in terms of nutrition um uh being more vulnerable to catch up diseases the spreading ones uh more vulnerable to uh um to the overcrowded shelters related uh potential uh gender-based violence and protection issues um access to Services become more difficult for women who are heading their households in in in the in the during the crisis and War unfortunately women for instance would be as you know the last to eat when it comes or the last to benefit from an humanitarian Necessities that reach the family in very small quantities today when I was on the phone with my colleague uh her granddaughter was crying for food I'm hungry I'm hungry and she told me you know I didn't drink water for 3 days just to save the water for the babies that we have here we have 1.5 uh one one and a half month baby and four months baby and we just try to save the water for them this is the situation unfortunately where they are severely affected unattended kids it's a huge full story also where families are not able to to report their missing kids and unattended kids are not connected to their family so the the situation is really harsh and it becomes even harsher for women and kids of different of different groups Yeah you mentioned your colleagues in Gaza they are working under unimaginable conditions what is it that you can do for them from where you are so all what we we we are trying our best to be connected to our colleagues on daily basis with the blackout of the communication that was a terrifying moment for us what we try to do is to secure as much as we can what we call uh hygiene kits survival kits dignity kits water food these are the colleagues who used to jump to help others now because they are displaced internally displaced and evacuated to the South we find them among those who need who need support as I mentioned they they are unable to access bread some of them they did not eat bread since 4 days now um and and we try our best but the the um the the Commodities are going are going missing from Gaza so we are trying to find for instance Water bottled water drinking water for them and it's not possible they rely could get two gallons of water one of them after long long uh um attempts that lasted for two days was hea Tibi from Care thank you so much and all the best to you and your team"}, "h5s1HYakay8": {"url":

Israelis are now known to have been killed since Hamas launched attacks on Saturday Palestinian sources say that more than 950 people have been killed by Israel's bombardment of Gaza where entire neighborhoods have been flattened Israel has sealed all Crossings into Gaza and the only Crossing from Gaza into Egypt at Rafa has been hit by Israeli a strikes while both sides have accused the other of war crimes Israel has accused Hamas of torturing and murdering babies and children in attacks which began on Saturday the Palestinian representative at the United Nations said Israel was planning to use starvation as a method of warfare well strikes against Gaza have continued this morning this was a blast just a couple of hours ago which sent black smoke billowing into the sky a huge blast there as you can see well this is the scene live in Gaza and just very very uh hazy uh background because the amount of smoke that has been released by these air missiles means it's very difficult to see in the distance you can see there uh black smoke uh pouring out of a broken window in a building in the foreground Alama spokesman says at least 30 people have been killed and hundreds wounded in over night strikes with residential buildings factories and mosques among the targets hit now we know that there has of course been a total Siege of blockade by the Israelis in Gaza and in the last few minutes the pope has come out with a statement and said he's very worried by the total Siege imposed on Palestinians in Gaza well let's hear now from our correspondent Nick beak with the very latest the Israeli city of ashalon has been hit by a stream of rockets overnight many were intercepted mid-flight by air defenses they'd been fired from inside Gaza a few miles to the South nearby Israeli forces have been seizing back control and moving into communities that Hamas had attacked this is far AA where soldiers say they've uncovered atrocities including the murder of mothers and their children the have just Jihad machine to kill everybody without weapons without nothing just normal citizens that want to take their breakfast and that's all and they kill them it's aggressive thing to see it's very difficult to see it but we must remember who is the enemy and what our mission our mission is the Justice where in the right side and all the world need to be behind us Israel says those who did this will will pay the heaviest price and this is their latest response the bombardment of Gaza continues Israeli strikes hitting Palestinian communities Israel's military released this footage showing its operations it says it's targeting Hamas Fighters hundreds of civilians have been killed the air strikes have caused huge damage to homes and shops [Music] I lost everything my house my shop has been destroyed completely where do we go we have become homeless the Israelis say Hamas has brought this upon Gaza Israel is accused of breaking international law supplies of food power and water into Gaza have been cut off just to the north across the wire Israeli troops are arriving in ever greater numbers senior commanders warning the next stage of their response will build up to a ground operation into Gaza we started the offensive from the air later on we will also come from the ground we've been controlling the area since day two and we are on the offensive it will only intensify the resistance the Israeli troops will encounter is likely to be fierce Hamas will be preparing to meet in advance the prospect is of even more Bloodshed in this part of the Middle East well Israel has called up 300,000 reservists to join its Frontline troops tanks and other heavy military equipment are massing near Gaza some has also been deployed to the northern border with Lebanon where there have been exchanges of gunfire across the border well the UN has called for the laws of war to be upheld which would include the release of hostages and the protection of civilians well let's go live now and speak to our chief International correspondent Le duet who is in ashalon in southern Israel and least just talk us through what you're seeing there in terms of Israeli preparations yes well ashalon is the biggest city in the southernmost part of Israel and we're outside of ashalon and just behind you can see some of the the troops in the distance some some Hardware some vehicles this is a closed military zone now there's been a lot more activity in this area this morning more troops racing by in in their vehicles more artillery going out you have a sense that this this edge of the Gaza Strip Gaza is just about 3 and a half miles uh behind it they they seem to be on edge there seem to be some preparations although some of the tanks which we had my colleagues had reported on earlier a line of tanks behind this tree line a lot of those that armor has moved away way all signs of what is widely known to be Israeli preparations for a possible land incursion we have no sense about how long that will take they may not know because this is an option that Israel has avoided for so long even prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has resisted this in the past and as you mentioned they have so far called up some 350,000 reservice we saw on the main road coming down from Jerusalem along long stretches of the road there cars all lined up because people come they get out of their cars they go to the military recruiting centers and they come down here to the front line we also know if you could just see there's a sign there for zakim it's a kabut just very close even closer to Gaza there was an infiltration yesterday we understand from C by a number of Hamas Fighters they were engaging and so while Israel is saying it's been saying since yesterday that it believes it has largely reclaimed control of the board order they also admit they cannot seal it there was even a penetration into ashalon last night by those paragliders that they used in those early hours of Saturday when this unprecedented assault first began and even now with this really uh it intense Israeli fortification all along this Southern Border close to the ga the wire with Gaza they're still able to penetrate and you can't see right now but behind us on the Horizon Blue of smoke constantly Rising Gaza coming under bombardment around the clock and Le we're getting details aren't we of other Israeli Villages and towns around the border with Gaza and what happened to them in terms of the Hamas military assault there yes here we are several days on from this extraordinary assault by Hamas land sea and air so far Israel saying it's recovered the bodies of 150 Hamas 1,500 Hamas Fighters that number Grows by the day and they're only now being able to go into some of the kutas yesterday we had the report from our International editor Jeremy Bowen being taken there by the Israeli Army into kafar AA the confirming the shocking reports of what happened when Hamas Fighters stormed the kapus push through the security around the kibuts and even yesterday there were still corpses rotting corpses lying on the ground both of Hamas Fighters but also residents of of that uh of that small Kut so mopping up operations are continuing and as they continue out comes to the stories which are really striking anger and fear but also a resolve in the heart of so many Israelis rallying behind their forces who are now saying whatever it takes they will do they will do in order to bring Hamas to its knees and we've been seeing we've been reporting on the BBC around the world particularly in Western countries Western leaders staunchly standing up for Israel's right to defend itself but there are voices including the eu's foreign policy Chief including the un's human rights Chief saying that Israel has the right to defend itself but there are also rules of War raising questions about this blister in Siege of Gaza a Complete Siege denying the residents of Gaza food fuel electricity and Waters targeting civilians in a time of war is a war crime but right now in Israel and in the Gaza Strip you feel our by hour those rules are are being shattered Le thank you very much indeed our chief International correspondent Le duet who is in southern Israel just outside ashalon for us well it's the whole Mark of the violence in Israel and GH that youngsters and children have been victims the BBC knows of many young people who are kidnapped by Hamas the images of boys and girls and babies in their mother's arms being led away are amongst the most harrowing of this war so far Caroline Hy has that story imagine that you know and love these children all are now hostages in Gaza and the weight the absence of news is torture this is 30-year-old Israeli mother Shir on Saturday morning in the hands of her captors still in her arms her 9-month-old baby cafir and her 4-year-old Ariel they were kidnapped from their kabut near the border with Gaza

Saturday morning on a holiday in Israel they were sleep in their beds my feeling that my family is over there that I I don't know how to treat them and I know that there is N9 months H baby that

next but I can tell you this is just the beginning the UN Secretary General urged both sides to protect civilians even Wars have rules International humanitarian law and human rights law must be respected and upheld civilians must be protected and also never use the shields it's exactly a week since Hamas gunman Ram paged through southern Israel families still coming to terms with the lives

support katia's son among those missing thing we are very anxious our hope is that our child comes back we cannot think otherwise our child has to come home a deep sense of for boing the ratcheting up of this crisis seems inevitable Nick Johnson BBC News well we're now joined by Lord Mark Malik Brown former deputy Secretary General of the UN and current president of the open Society foundations thank you for joining us we've been discussing the proposal put forth by Russia to call for a ceasefire what's your feeling on this proposal do do you think there's any chance that a ceasefire might be implemented I mean it'd be wonderful if there could be a ceasefire and you know the Brazil Brazilians who chair the security Council this month have also got a much more balanced resolution which begins with a condemnation of Hamas for its attacks on Israeli citizens and then goes on simly to call for a ceasefire to allow proper humanitarian access and support to civilians at risk in Gaza and you know I I would love to believe that the security Council can can come together around that but in fact there are a pretty wide range of views at the moment with some Western countri us particularly you know certainly calling for humanitarian restraint but also you know feeling and their correct in law that Israel has an absolute right to uh you know strike back at Hamas which it does um and by putting that first and foremost it's inhibited its ability to the US has inhibited its ability to also demand a ceasefire and respect for the rule of law and the and for humanitarian law so you know the trouble is a lot of Israel's friends are a little ambivalent at Best in their messaging you know recognizing Israel's right to self-defense and then leaving very much in second place uh respect for uh the civilians at risk and and so it it's tragically hard to see how we get quickly enough to a point where both sides pause hold back and try and allow a little space not just for humanitarian protection but for the beginnings of diplomacy as well Lord Malik Brown then what do the discussions that are going on at un headquarters in New York tell us about the the health the strength of the United Nations in general is there any prospect that the UN as a body can really Institute peace between the Israelis and the the Palestinians well look I think the Secretary General who you know has been criticized quite a lot lately for a fairly sort of weak performance at the recent UN General Assembly when he sort of acknowledged his organization was broken has had actually a good first week of this crisis he has an article in today's New York Times which is very balanced which uh calls for a suspension of the violence and uh humanitarian protection and acknowledges the longstanding wrongs against both communities against Israel Israelis and against Palestinians and the need for both uh to to have a political voice and to arrive at a political solution uh to their decades long uh confrontation and but the security Council as I say while I think it's a happy accident that this month it's chaired by Brazil a country which is always trying to find peace and a m way to any conflict it's been criticized we trying to do that in the case of Ukraine and Russia but I think that's exactly the skill set we need in the chair of the council at the moment but you know so and and you know similarly the humanitarian Chief at the UN has spoken out strongly against the risk of the risk the one million Palestinians who are being pressed by Israel to move to the south of the country the Red Cross has come out strongly so you know there are a lot of principled moral voices speaking up but you know to the real import of your question will it lead to an early resolution of this I suspect not this you know a terrible crime was committed last weekend and I suspect Israel will not be satisfied until it is you know militarily uh disarmed neutralized Hamas but what Israel needs to remember and what the UN needs to keep saying is there may be a military solution to Hamas that is not a military solution to the Palestinians uh for the Palestinian people there has to be a political solution and that's been postponed for decades and each time there's a crisis like that this it seems to get kicked further back into the long ground Lord Mal Brown as as you're speaking I just want to to bring in an alert that we've just received um from AFP they're saying that Saudi Arabia has paused talks on the normalization of ties with Israel can you reflect on that development where does that leave Israel now that those those talks that have been going on for quite some time now fostered by the United States with Saudi Arabia have been paused well I I think this would was anticipated it would have been impossible for Saudi Arabia to have continued them at this time uh you know it is in recent years been quite quiet on the issue of Palestinian rights but when uh the events of this week unfolded it you know raised its voice much more clearly in defense of uh the Palestinian people and it would be just in terms of uh the Optics and politics of the region impossible to press on uh in any effort to to to normalize relations with with Israel at the very same time that Israel was seen as attacking Palestinian Arab civilians uh in Gaza but I don't know whether in the longer term I mean I think this is now up to Israel whether it wants to close that door forever which would be the result of a which will happen I think if it makes a long-term occupation or long-term milit milary intervention uh into Gaza or whether it recognizes the need to contain its military action in as Surgical and brief a form as possible so that it can get this back on track because for both Israel and Saudi Arabia the stakes are high it would be a reordering of of the Middle East in a dramatic way and I think uh you know there will be a desire to try once the fighting is dies down to to try and recover this negotiation okay really good to hear your thoughts on the Diplomatic front Lord Mark Malik Brown former deputy Secretary General of the UN and current president of the open Society foundations Lord Malik Brown reflecting there on the news that Saudi Arabia has paused talks on normalization of ties with Israel that information coming to us from AFP and we'll bring you

troops have already severed Gaza City from the south of the territory for more I'm now joined by DW correspondent Ben fulan who is in Jerusalem Ben it is one month now since Hamas terrorists attacked Israel murdered more than 1,400 people and abducted more than 230 people to Gaza how are Israelis remembering today uh it's a going to be a a day of mixed feelings a full day of remembrance with flags flying at half master right now I'm just a stone throw away from the gates to East Jerusalem to the old city where there will be uh vigils held by Palestinians and Israelis uh together to remember all those who've died so far during this conflict but I'm right in front of one of the uh vigils where people have been lighting candles just moments ago uh and you can see the posters of those who were kidnapped uh but as I say there are also this is going to be a day of feelings there are also going to be protests protests outside the entrance to the knesset the parliament people are also angry about the government's response also the government's uh performance leading up until this time the uh surveillance records of the government and uh the fact that there were security lapses and that this happened at all security lapses to say the least uh Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has expressed openness at least in theory to Tactical pauses can you tell us anything more about that well uh the general mood here is also for no ceasefire and Mr Netanyahu has made that extremely clear this talk of there being a temporary truce or a humanitarian pause uh is really only talk at the moment uh there have been demands from uh Arab leaders for this uh but until all hostages are returned uh this is not going to be on the table as far as Mr Netanyahu goes in an interview uh with the US uh News Network ABC Netanyahu made significant comments about Gaza let's listen in those who don't want to uh continue the way of Hamas it certainly is not I think Israel will for an indefinite period will have the overall uh security respons ibility because we've seen what happens when we don't have it when we don't have that security responsibility what we have is the eruption of uh Hamas Terror on a scale that we couldn't imagine Ben Netanyahu there saying the country will take responsibility over the Gaza Strip after destroying Hamas what exactly does he mean this is the most interesting development we've had in days as far as uh the political side of this debate goes and it's the first time we've heard any sort of mention from Netanyahu about a plan the day after the day after the war that is because there's been a lot of criticism uh as to uh netanyahu's response sending in these forces now in full force but without a plan for what's going to happen afterwards the Palestinian Authority which is in a very weak position right now has been suggested by US Secretary of State blinken to uh be revived revitalized and to Take Over Control of the Gaza Strip there are a lot of doubts about whether or not it can do that the other suggestion has been uh a group of countries and international agencies to provide governance and security for the Gaza Strip but as you heard there it sounds like Benjamin Netanyahu wants to do that that is DW's Ben fulan reporting from Jerusalem many thanks Ben I'd like to now welcome Frank ledwidge a senior lecturer in strategic studies at Portsmouth University and a former UK Military Intelligence officer Frank uh Israeli troops have encircled Gaza City and are preparing to push into the city center do we have any idea how many Hamas Fighters they're expecting to confront there well good morning Michael I think we don't have an idea of that but I'm absolutely certain that there is probably fairly fairly accurate assess assessment on the part of the Intelligence Officers of the 36th division of the Israeli Army the most powerful armored unit they have uh who are about to enter so I can't really speculate on that the overall context is that there are 20 or 30,000 within Gaza The Enclave itself but there's no way of telling how many in Gaza City I would suspect there are going to be a fairly High number as I will want to make a stand the Israeli uh projection is that this particular phase of the operation for Gaza City will take months not weeks it is in fact existential for uh Hamas so I take your point um Israel's made it repeatedly clear their goal is the destruction of Hamas in particular its leadership and their headquarters in Gaza City does the IDF believe Hamas leaders are in fact still there they say that they have over the last four weeks or so probably the last two weeks really killed in the region of 30 senior commanders that's Brigade commanders that's commanders of about 3 or 400 and Battalion commanders 100 or so the numbers are different than Western armies which would indicate that they do uh believe that some of the leadership is there now one of the functions of cordoning off that the northern Gaza area into the northern sector of operations is to seal off Hamas leadership and of course personnel who are already there and kill them or capture them I suppose in some cases and I have no doubt at all that the assumption is that there there is significant elements of Hamas leadership there of course the overall leadership is in Qatar although there are operational commanders Dave for example who are still certainly in Gaza now the Israeli Army is advancing into the city with the 36th division we understand some of the best trained Personnel in the IDF what more can you tell us about this division it's one of the older units in the Israeli Army it's a what the Americans would call a stored unit with battle oners going way back into the 50s and and late 40s I think but I think it's important to Bear one thing in mind Orly many things really but one thing particularly is the power of this of this unit so to put things in context it has combat power comparable combat power not numbers here so the numbers probably between 10 and 20,000 plus support and Logistics SS but the combat power is similar to that of the British army so that one division there eight or nine reserve and regular divisions in the Israeli Army divided into brigades but the 36th division has combat power equivalent to the British army so when you see those pictures of these all inspiring shock and or barges not only from the artillery that's what you're seeing you're seeing the power of a large modern well equipped Army and its most powerful division about to go into action like I say just to stress by Western European standards it's an extremely powerful unit very well equipped Frank I'm curious uh if the Israeli Army succeeds in taking over Gaza City what does it mean for the progress of this war is it essentially over or will they face something like what the American forces confronted after toppling Baghdad a smattering but persistent resistance of Guerilla forces hiding among the local population I have no doubt whatsoever that they will and this fed into the decision by Netanyahu I think over the last or expressed over the last day to for Israel to take control of this because there's no appetite whatsoever on the part of the Arab countries who talk a great game but do very little with respect to Security in that particular region and even less I think with the British the French and the Americans who I think have had quite enough of occupying hostile areas in the Middle East so essentially left only the Israelis and of course the Israelis will be facing undoubtedly as you put it dister Guerilla action when and if well when they they they take this area the question for me and I don't know the answer to this is what as you said what will they do then will they then start grinding South will they start incrementally going South to put a huge pressure of course on the population and resources we don't know the answer to that yet but for now the question is how long will this take the answer is this phase months reminds me of what former Secretary of State Coen pal said he said you break it you own it when he was talking about Iraq of course that is a Frank ledwich senior lecturer in strategic studies at Portsmouth University and a former UK Military Intelligence officer many thanks as always Frank thank you Michael let's now bring in Shaya low a communication adviser with the Norwegian Refugee Council based in Jerusalem Shaina the UN chief Antonio gues says nowhere is safe in Gaza very few would know this better than your own team on the ground there what are they telling you so we have a staff of 54 trapped inside of Gaza most of our staff has fled from the north to the center and south of Gaza but as as you said no safe no place is safe uh just this morning I spoke to my colleague Yousef who's in KH Unis who told me that there was an air strike on a building very close to where he was sleeping uh around 6:00 a.m. this morning uh day after day we are hearing from our colleagues that who even those who have fled that the south is not safe uh we've had colleagues lose family members in the South including one of our colleagues Amal whose seven-year-old son khed was killed in an air strike on Rafa a couple of weeks ago uh and and what we're hearing in addition is not just is it not safe in the South but similar to the north people now are struggling to find basic necessities uh food clean water um uh even waiting in line five six hours a day just to get half a portion of bread um the Palestinian uh red crescent uh says that Aid deliveries into Gaza are much lower now than before the war I'm afraid it's a question we'll keep asking until there's significant change on the ground but how dire is humanitarian situation today each day it seems to be getting worse and worse just two days ago I spoke to a couple of my colleagues who told me that they hadn't been able to find any water that day and were res resorting to drinking Cola because they had no Alternatives um we are struggling Even in our Aid distribution that we're working on to find water and procure water to distribute to those who have been internally displaced day after day we're hearing that it's getting to be even more of a struggle to find these basic Goods um and until there's a a huge ramping up of the assistance going into Gaza people in in throughout all of Gaza are going to continue to suffer the important thing also to note is while we need a huge increase in the amount of Aid going in I think we had 90 true trucks yesterday which still fell short of the 100 trucks minimum that the UN has said is needed uh in Gaza is we need uh fuel to be order to in order to be able to distribute that Aid throughout all of Gaza and reaching the few 100,000 people who remain in Northern Gaza and we also need a ceasefire in order to assure that that humanitarians can go and distribute that Aid and people seeking assistance can go and access that Aid safely and without concerns that they will be uh killed killed while seeking out Aid understood your organization is one of many asking for ceasefire one month after the conflict started what are your hopes you know it feels hopeless day after day but we need to keep pushing the International Community to demand a ceasefire Palestinians in Gaza cannot take it any longer each day our colleagues tell us is the worst day of their lives and the next day turns out to be harder than the previous one uh a ceasefire cannot come soon enough we need an end to this madness we need an end to these hostilities we need an end to the killing and displacement uh really I cannot stress how much we are praying and hoping for a ceasefire uh despite the fact that we're hearing uh resistance coming from Israeli authorities our thanks uh to Shaina low from the Norwegian Refugee Council for your time and your perspective thank you well the European union says it is stepping up its delivery of Aid to Gaza so for more on this let's bring in DW correspondent Rosie burchard who is standing by for us at an airport in Belgium ausen Brugge airport where a plane with Aid is preparing to depart good morning to you ra Rosie good to see you so tell us what Aid is actually being sent yeah good morning from aad near the Belgian coast and behind me that plane is getting filled up with humanitarian Aid mostly what I've been told is it's nutritional supplements so food to get to people and also Health supplies so medicines equipment for hospitals which we're told is really there's a dire need for it now that plane will be bound for Egypt where it will be taken the stocks will be taken by the Egyptian red crescent and then into Gaza now the EU says it's had has over the past month essentially quadrupled its humanitarian Aid aid for Palestinians and we've heard from the EU commissioner this morning here at this airport saying that the humanitarian situation in Gaza is dire I asked him if he had a message for people there and he said he wanted to let them know that the EU has not forgotten about them and we'll stand by their side right well getting Aid uh shipped is naturally a good start Rosie but how effectively is this reaching people in Gaza well I spoke to a representative of the Red Cross here and he put summed it up really clearly he said well no a is any use if it's stuck in a truck and so far the figures that we've been given here this morning are that several hundred trucks of Aid have been able to enter Gaza through that Rafa crossing over the past few weeks but that was described to me by this humanitarian worker as simply a drop in the ocean and we also had a persistent call a ref A Renewed call from the eu's humanitarian Aid Chief saying there needs to be more humanitarian access there is not enough there's not enough ways for them to get Aid in so the fact that moid is being sent obviously the EU wants to send that message of support but also they say they're continuing to press they say all parties to try and let more to get more access to so that more Aid can actually make it to those people in that dire need as described here by EU officials now the United Nations has insisted on a ceasefire where does the European Union stand on that well the European Union is divided you might have heard me say this on many other topics but really on this one EU countries are have been battling over this really negotiating down to every single detail of every single word officially the EU the European Council so that's the member states have called for humanitarian pauses and corridors for humanitarian needs so essentially pauses in fighting to let Aid in now the commissioner here this morning who represents the European commission so that's the executive arm of the European Union said it doesn't matter which word you use whether it's a pause whether it's a corridor whether it's a ceasefire but of course for a divided group of member states words really do matter and the EU is still pretty much at odds over this even if they have managed to negotiate some statements so far now there have also been what was first described as a kind of muddled response there was an announcement weeks ago just in the direct aftermath of the attacks there would be a suspension of certain development payments that was then backtracked on so somewhat muddled response so far but certainly officials here this morning trying to send one message of support today say the people in Gaza thanks Rosie DW correspondent

know there was some sort of incursion into Gaza overnight by the Israeli military we don't know exactly what happened and what the the aim of it was what more can you tell us certainly according to the Israeli military a spokesperson for the Army saying that yes in indeed there were raids into we understand to be the northern Gaza Strip last night um the Army saying that um they recovered what they describe as several Israeli bodies I think the idea of this raid well that's what's being reported at least was obviously to try and get or try and retrieve either bodies or rescue some of those that were were captured um bear in mind that Israel's reporting that at least 150 people were taken by Hamas gunman into Gaza including many women and children and we've seen some of those videos um pretty shocking videos it must be said um certainly of some of the children and elderly women that were taken um it's worth bearing in mind that Israel is under increasing pressure uh sorry the Israeli military is under increasing pressure both in Israeli media just generally throughout Israeli Society they want to see some sort of effort more of an effort by the Israeli Army in doing all they can to try and get these hostages out before an expected um land Invasion into Gaza we know how difficult that that could be um the Israeli military is saying that along with those several bodies that there were items um belonging it believed to be belonging to those um those that were captured that according to the military they hope could lead to uh possibly more rescues or at least the retrieving of um those that are killed but as I say it is an incredibly risky operation um very difficult indeed we understand that um Special Forces May well have been um used in this operation but you know um a lot of people are saying this is is really more of a as much a PR exercise as anything because it is is just so difficult we know how how long a process the kind of planning for just getting a couple of hostages out of a situation like that in an area like Gaza would take the Israeli military um let alone 150 but it's another indication that um we could indeed be seeing some sort of ground Movement by Israeli forces into the Gaza Strip in the coming hours or days um because as I say it is it's important that the Israeli military at least be seen to be doing all they can to get back those that are captured by Hamas Fighters and have been taken into Gaza as you say Charles a lot of speculation now that a ground Invasion into Gaza is imminent what is your sense from where you are well it's undeniable that um obviously we've seen in in recent days this huge great troop build up mil Hardware being brought down to Southern Israel vast amounts of Tanks um apc's various other heavy weapons being used we've seen obviously an air campaign a bombing campaign that has so far at least killed around 2,000 Palestinians and destroyed vast amounts vast areas of the Gaza Strip um but in the last couple of days we've seen some of those troops and some of that Hardware being moved we understand into potentially more forward operational positions so yeah all indications are is that we are not far away potentially from some sort of ground Invasion interestingly in the last couple of hours or so and Israeli military spokesperson for the in Arabic has said that um the uh the Israeli forces is Israeli Air Force will not bomb two Roots two Roots evacuation routs uh for a number of hours to allow this evacuation to continue um the exact statement is is that these two these two routs will be uh left alone will not be bombed between the hours of 10 a.m. and 400 p.m. today so again another indication that all preparations are being made for some serious large scale potential ground Invasion into Gaza in the coming hours or days okay thank you for that update Charles stford there for us live live in ashdod let's speak now to Yousef alabad he's a retired Colonel and International Security analyst he joins us now from estle thank you for your time sir we were hearing there from our correspondent about the pressure that the Israeli Army is clearly under to retrieve these 150 hostages We Believe at least that's what we're being told that are in Gaza how tricky is that when you you factor in some sort of ground Invasion what is the reality going to be from a military Invasion point of view so from the military perspective to find the hostages in a very highly dense population area will not be so easy for the Israel Defense Forces for that reason isra should always take into consideration during the ground operation the lives of the hostages which was taken captured kidnapped uh by the Hamas militants for that reason that is easy to say but hard to carry out for this reason uh how Israel will accomplish to save the lives of the hostages during a ground operation uh is still uh carrying lots of risk for the especially the civilian hostages okay thank you Yousef uh stay with us because we will return to you later in the program Yousef alabada a retired konel International Security analyst from Istanbul"}, "uE9Dp-zI8LQ": {"url":

senior un official has accused both sides of committing war crimes he's our Middle East correspondent y your land nail with the latest Israel's vast military might on display once again it says Hamas has lost control in Northern Gaza and its troops are battling inside Gaza City this is a critical point in the war and for the first time the BBC was given access behind Israeli lines in Gaza escorted by soldiers while the BBC had editorial control of the report these pictures were cleared for use by the Israeli military amid the huge destruction officers showed what they said was a Hamas weapons factory set up they said below a family apartment a child's bedroom they insisted that Hamas not Israel was responsible for civilian loss of life we know intelligence we know what we hit we know the targets they're approved by the by our Command it's not that I wake up and my my objective is to to ruin the the city I aim for enemy an enemy only Israel says its actions in Gaza where it's trying to eradicate Hamas are a military necessity that this war is about self-defense but Air's view is different she says that because of Israel's bombardment nowhere is safe there's no food or drinking water for the children and that Israel has bombed the bakeries Israel says that 50,000 Palestinians moved South in Gaza yesterday when it promised safe passage but during the day deadly Israeli air strikes were reported across the length of the strip the Hamas run authorities now say that more than 10 and a half thousand people have been killed the UN Secretary General says the civilian death toll in Gaza shows something is clearly wrong with Israeli military operations but also Al that Hamas is using people as human Shields meanwhile the un's human rights commissioner visiting the region is accusing both Israel and Hamas of war crimes after G7 top diplomats voiced their concerns at a meeting in Japan attention is also beginning to turn to the post-war future the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin said there should be a United Palestinian L government for Gaza and the West Bank as a step towards Palestinian statehood uh it's also clear that Israel cannot occupy Gaza um now the reality is that there may be uh a need for some transition period uh at the end of the conflict but it is imperative that um the Palestinian people uh be Central to uh to governance uh in uh in Gaza and in the West Bank as well but for now this conflict rages on Hamas be hugely outgunned but its Guerilla tactics on the streets of Gaza could keep the war with Israel going for months to come yoland Nell BBC News Jerusalem well more on this the French government is hosting a conference in Paris to discuss ways of getting humanitarian Aid to people in Gaza delegations from several Arab nations are attending but Israel will not be represented and its main backer the United States is only sending a lowlevel team well let's go live now to Paris and our correspondent Hugh scoffield Hugh let's just start with the conference itself what is France hoping to achieve well it's hoping that this will lead to some kind of breakthrough in getting Aid into Gaza um they're assembling some very iminent people you know the head of unra the relief agency is going to be talking um um the head of the International Red Cross will be here briefing delegates on the situation um and the hope is that they with the delegations will come up with creative ideas about getting Aid in about establishing establishing field hospitals uh getting fuel down into the Gaza Strip and so on I have to say there's a huge degree of skepticism though about about this uh conference which was hastily organized um in the last few days and and it's really just a kind of adjunct to an existing peace Forum which president macron um had been planning which will discuss a lot of other issues such as global warming and uh uh um Ai and so on and this was sort of tacked on to the beginning because of the pressing problem of Gaza but I don't think there's a huge expectation that it's going to lead to anything par particularly significant but it does send perhaps a message to Israel and Israel isn't sending a delegation to the conference and the French government has talked about not wanting to offend the Israeli government yeah we need to be quite clear that the Israelis are not sending dation but primarily because they weren't invited and that's not intended to snub the Israelis the the idea was that this would be a a conference of countries that are interested in getting Aid into to uh Gaza donor countries and Israel obviously does not count among them so um there's no intention of snubs in either direction um but what is the case I think is that this does have a PO itical Dimension um the French government President Ma in particular has been accused by some here in France many here in France of adopting a kind of Nee pro-israeli um reaction and of uh in the initial aftermath of the October the 7th attacks you know coming down very very very too firmly on behalf on the side of of Israel and all of this and there is pressure certainly from the foreign ministry here to redress the balance some somewhat and show that you know France also shares the concerns of the Arab world of the South um more largely um and their concerns about humanitarian difficulties in Gaza so that does address that and does send out a message and does send out a message about how the world increasingly is hoping for some kind of humanitarian pause in the fighting yes thank you very much that's our correspondent in Paris Hugh scoffield well as Hugh mentioned there there has been some skepticism about the conference including from Aid organizations and human rights groups and we can now talk to Sasha deshmuk who's the chief executive of Amnesty International UK here in London Sasha thank you very much for joining us so Amnesty International has issued a statement ahead of this conference saying the focus should be on calling for a ceasefire yes we've welcomed the International Community focusing on the humanitarian situation in Gaza at this conference we have said that a ceasefire we believe is an important step that can mean that there can be a chance for the delivery of sustained and effective Aid in Gaza there can be a chance for the burying of the Dead there can be a chance for the treatment of the many many people wounded and also critically during a ceasefire there can be an intensification of negotiations trying to ensure the return of hostages which of course must also be a critical Focus but do you understand Israel's position because you've been calling for a ceasefire but the Israeli government says any pause in fighting would benefit Hamas and it has a responsibility to protect its citizens well all states have a responsibility to self-defense um of their citizens they actually have that as a duty but that Duty can never be undertaken by committing War crime and as you've reported um many experts including the United Nations commissioner have spoken now about war crimes that have been conducted both by Hamas but also by the Israeli authorities I believe that a ceasefire is critical in this situation um I believe that it does provide would provide an opportunity not only for the delivery of critical humanitarian Aid in a sustained way but also provide a critical opportunity for a focus on the hostages as well of course that hostage taking is a terrible crime as well many people watching might be wondering what happens next because the United States most countries are either calling for a ceasefire or a pause in fighting what can what more can be done well I think within a ceasefire as well as the delivery of humanitarian Aid as well as a focus on the return of the hostages critically also there needs to be a focus on human rights and the journey to a longer term solution which I believe needs to be based on human rights within a ceasefire we also need to see um investigators from the United Nations uh commission for human rights from organizations such as Amnesty International as well as the international criminal court be allowed access be allowed to actually give the world truth about what has been happening the crimes committed by both sides but critically also what does it then mean for there to be a human rights solution a human rights based Journey out of this conflict I believe it's only with a focus on human rights that we're going to see the end of what has been a decades long crisis and also focusing particularly on Gaza we need to remember that the current situation which within which we're calling for a ceasefire is also been an intensification of a 16-year long blockade of Gaza that action in and of itself is been an illegal action thank you very much that's Sasha deshmuk chief executive of Amnesty International UK thanks for joining us well for the latest on the conflict let's go live now to our correspondent Mark Len who's in southern Israel and Mark as we've been reporting there were about 50,000 people who left Northern Gaza yesterday and the Israeli military saying it's going to open a key highway for people to leave once again today what do we know about the movement of people and how they're managing to get out of Northern Gaza well there is this Main Highway as you say Katherine the salalen road which which goes from the northern tip of Gaza down uh down to the South and that is the road that the Israelis are trying to encourage civilians to take in order to flee the most intense uh military uh air strikes in the north of Gaza and the Israeli Defense Forces say that 50,000 took that road yesterday that is considered higher numbers than have taken it if if confirmed uh the the previous days um and the Israeli Defense Force say that they it could indeed be reopened again today there's been no official confirmation but the likelihood is that it would be reopened as the Israelis try to get the civilians to flee South but remember there are still tens of thousands maybe even hundreds of thousands who are still in the north uh as the Israeli Defense Forces push further into Gaza City now um the Israelis say that Hamas has lost control of Northern Gaza uh there was they say an intense 10-hour battle yesterday to take control of a Hamas stronghold um and the offensive in into Gaza City pushes deeper meanwhile there is some um possible good news on on on the on the hostages uh with the um with reports that the Qatari government is mediating for the release potentially of 12 hostages including some Americans uh the Americans believe that 10 US Nationals are still being held under Hamas captivity uh and we understand that those talks are ongoing and Mark we've been talking so far in the program about a possible ceasefire or pause in the fighting the United States other allies other isra other other allies of Israel are calling for the same are we seeing any sign of that from the government there well certainly not a ceasefire that the the Benjamin Netanyahu is ruled out if unless there is a full release of the hostages and that's very un likely to happen what we're talking about really is humanitarian pauses and pauses in the fighting and yesterday the Israeli military announced for the first time that there would be a 4-Hour pause in three large neighborhoods of Gaza City uh in order for food and water to be um to be reached by the civilians uh but residents there saying that there is such a shortage of food and water that they were unable to get very much during those those pauses but that was the first time that there had been apparently an official announcement from inside Gaza City um meanwhile uh the you what what what appears to be happening are kind of more localized stoppages uh in in in some isolated places on the ground I don't think we're necessarily going to get an official announcement from the Israeli government about a humanitarian pause I think it's going to be more localized stoppages for people to be able to access Aid uh so far um uh yesterday we are told that 86 trucks uh crossed from Rafa in Egypt into Gaza carrying aid but that is still just a drop in the ocean in terms of the needs on the ground thank you very much that's our correspondent there in southern Israel Mark Lauren"},

more that we will ever do the new phase of Israel's assault started last night with dozens of air strikes Israel believes overwhelming military strength can pacify Gaza but military power alone has never brought lasting quiet let alone peace in this conflict's long history Israel claimed one of its strikes killed a senior Hamas Commander Israeli tanks and soldiers moved forward into the North north of the Gaza Strip gaza's visible from a hill in stot Israel will resist pressure for a ceasefire and there's another Factor the more Palestinians that Israel kills especially civilians the greater the levels of anger and outrage elsewhere in the Middle East among Israel's friends as well as its enemies now that doesn't guarantee that the war would spread but it does increase levels of anger and volatility in a part of the world that is already very fragile Israel's ground war has started containing it here is now the biggest political and diplomatic challenge in the world Jeremy bone BBC News in southern Israel in gazer itself most people are now unreachable the UN says that ambulances and civil defense teams are no longer able to locate the injured after the communications blackout in Gaza our correspondent Rashi Abu Alou was finally able to get through to us he said the north of the territory surrounding Gaza City was hit overnight on a scale we've never seen before he sent us this report from the southern city of K Yunis you know communication is very very difficult in in Gaza since 24 hours as Israel cut all of the communication mobile carrier the two main mobile carriers are not functioning the internet lines are not functioning in everywhere and getting information is really hard and difficult very few people who are still having international SIM cards and they can do rooming using Israeli mobile services people who close to uh to the Border they still can communicate and between time to time they uh post some uh on social media they also some of the local radio uh station are still functioning and they they they were able to talk to their correspondent in the north who described what happened last night as the biggest ever air strike that targeted this area he said that it was like an earthquake we understand that the Indonesian hospital was struck with an N Strike yesterday the hospital was out of service for quite a long time like a week ago the hospital was out of service because no fuel and was evacuated but today it was the main building of the hospital was destroyed also around chifa Hospital in Gaza City there was a a lot of air strikes 10 15 air strikes according to people around chifa hospital they are cutting most of the roads towards that hospital communication as I said is extremely difficult we are unable to verify a lot of reports about the the number of people dead or injured but as far as the health Ministry was was doing a press conference uh this uh this afternoon they said about 400 people were killed

department Israeli strikes have already hit the area around down the hospital but some feel leaving isn't safe either and despite the growing risk from air attacks thousands of Palestinians are running out of places to run to let's bring in Toby fricker here he is a spokesperson for the United Nations Children's Fund UNICEF he joins us from Aman Jordan Toby UNICEF has people on the ground in Gaza what are they telling you about the situation there yeah that's right UNICEF has a team on the ground in the Gaza Strip uh we lost communication for around 24 hours but thankfully yesterday we were in touch again with the staff what they're saying is the situation is is really horrific uh you know we have a staff member called nesma who has a four-year-old seven-year-old girl uh she was telling us about how how petrified they are her four-year-old has been you resorting to to sort of self harm pulling her hair scratching her her thighs because she's in such fear and and the trauma's affected her so so much but at the same time they're struggling to get access to to the essentials for life so Safe Water they've been drinking salty water now for around 10 days um and her children have been saying yeah why can't I have you know clean water safe water again regular water um so the situation is is is horrific for for every child inside the Gaza Strip right now there's a lot of concern Toby about what's happening in Gaza City particularly at the aifa and alud hospitals what can you tell tell us about the situation there yeah well I think the hospitals have been under massive strain I mean even before this escalation uh the resources that hospitals had were limited in terms of medical supplies in terms of fuel and now with this escalation the situation is really horrific first of all they're treating people who are wounded children who are wounded in in in attacks but they're also treating people particularly children newborns in incubators and others for for for diseases and and regular issues that happen all the time um and now we you we're extremely concerned from from what we hear about the situation you know under International humanitarian law let's not forget that healthc care facilities are are protected and that's absolutely critical at this time as the World Health Organization and others said you know moving any anyone from any hospital is essentially a death sentence a UN General Assembly resolution has called for an immediate ceasefire that's among growing demands for a humanitarian pause in the fighting do you believe that we will see the opening of humanitarian corridors anytime soon well we very much hope so uh that we'll see uh increased humanitarian access safe unimpeded access that is not just oneof deliveries but is sustained we really need to scale up the amount of life-saving supplies that can come in some have come in but it's it's certainly by no means enough given the immense needs that are inside the Gaza Strip and that's why UNICEF that's why the UN Secretary General keep calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire so that humanitarians can safely move supplies around first of all get them in and then move them around to reach uh people who are in such need at this time the focus of your organization of course is children you described to us uh an anecdote from one of one of your uh employees on the ground there how are children in general being affected by this war because I understand the number of casualties among children is very high yeah I mean the number of casualties is is horrific I mean more than 3,300 children have reportedly been killed you know another more than 6,300 children reportedly been injured you know the these numbers are are immense and and horrific uh so first of all what people are trying to do is protect the lives of their children you know the staff member I spoke about nesma she's been her her first priority is to protect her children's lives understandably of course but she's also trying to do a job a humanitarian job to support other other children to support other families who are also having massive massive needs um so the situation is really horrific and then and then there's the access to to Services you know to Health Services to essential service to that safe water that we spoke about it's so critical to to keep children alive and that's where we're at it's really about life-saving work Toby thank you very much for taking time to talk with us today that was Toby fricker spokesperson for Unicef speaking to us from Aman Jordan thank you our correspondent Rebecca ritters has the latest now on the Israeli ground offensive from ashdod close to the Gaza Border in southern Israel it's very very hard to get access impossible to get access but very hard to know what's happening on the ground in Gaza we've been witnessing or hearing at least a lot of the second phase of this war this expanded ground Invasion we know that that continued to expand the Israeli military telling us again this morning that they're bolstering and expanding in the the scale and scope of this ground Invasion but exactly what's happening on the ground is is very very hard to verify we're getting peac Mill bits of information we we it seems to appear or there are reports that Israeli military ground forces are now around about 3 kilomet inside that periphery of Gaza uh and there's hand to-hand combat going on we've heard that there were uh there was rather a big battle around the arz crossing um but we don't know anything about numbers the Israeli military saying that they uh targeted many Hass militants but seeing in some of the Palestinian telegram uh telegram TR chats excuse me that also some soldiers were killed as well but as I say very hard to verify exactly what's happening on the inside we know that there was a huge internet blackout for nearly 36 hours from Friday uh into Sunday morning and that made tell Communications obviously getting news out even more difficult was such a relief yesterday morning when we were finally able uh to reach some of our colleagues there but you can imagine the fear for the the Garin on the ground not able to get in touch with their loved ones not to be able to get in touch with Emergency Services when in fact there were air strikes in their area so a very serious uh terrible situation happening and just so difficult for us to be able to really know exactly what's happening now Hamas still has more than 200 hostages has there been any progress backa in negotiating their release well that number last night actually was risen uh by to 239 now there's still 40 people missing so that number could well rise again Terry the negotiations We Believe are still ongoing Qatar playing a very big role in those negotiations but we also know that Qatar have said or prior to the ground Invasion K Kat negotiators said that it would make negotiations very difficult if the Israeli military were to go in they have now indeed done so and so we don't know the state of those negotiations there is some thought that perhaps a ground Invasion may put pressure on Hamas while we have other people saying that it's going to have the opposite effect and in fact the fact that the G ground Invasion has started means that getting those uh hostages out alive is almost impossible once again very hard to know look into the crystal ball but uh the lot of pressure on the government from the families of those hostages very upset very on Friday when the ground Invasion began they were very upset they were you know there was a meeting held with prime minister benjam Benjamin met Netanyahu to say that they were very angry that they weren't informed and the fact that this was happening meant that they you know almost had no they were starting to lose hope that their loved ones would come out alive so a very very serious situation also for the hostages you mentioned pressure Rebecca world leaders stepped up calls for desperately needed humanitarian Aid to reach Gaza what's Israel's response to that kind of international pressure well we're slowly starting to see more Aid go into Gaza though nowhere near the amount that's needed for the people there on the ground uh overnight 33 more trucks were allowed in but we're getting eight saying some eight organizations saying that more than 80 a day are required for the needs of the people there and that we're just not seeing anything in those numbers now in the beginning Israel was hesitant to allow any Aid to go through it all when President US President Biden came that deal uh he struck a deal that to be agreed the get the Israelis to agree to start allowing Aid coming in we've been seeing that slowly trickle over but a hell of a lot more is needed for what's the the humanitarian catastrophe that's unfolding on the ground though as I say 33 trucks more came in overnight and yesterday the language from the military started to change they started saying that they would be allowing more and more trucks to come through now whether that's because they know that this is going to take a very long time and they simply have to allow Aid in uh so that the humanitarian catastrophe uh doesn't completely explode on the ground uh you know that could really say something about their tactics but so far not enough Aid is getting through but hopefully in the coming days that will be expanded Rebecca thank you very much that was our correspondant Rebecca Ritter there in southern Israel for more on Israel's incursion into Gaza we can talk now to military analyst Mike Martin of King's College London Mike how do you see Israel's ground operation unfolding in the days and weeks ahead morning Terry um I I see it unfolding very slowly because it's it's quite a difficult thing to do to move into an urban area and to try and you know Israel said they want to destroy Hamas that's a very difficult thing to do and so what we've seen so far is Israel's crossed into the Gaza Strip hasn't gone into the urban area but is securing some areas outside of Gaza City itself now Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu he's been talking about this being a long and difficult War does Israel have any clear exit strategy that you can see Mike I cannot see an Israeli uh exit strategy um these sorts of Wars unconventional Wars always end with a political settlement so they can't be solved militarily and so the question for Israel is okay it's going to go in there it will take out some Hamas tunnel tunnels it will kill some of the leadership very unlikely to destroy Hamas and then what they've then still got the same problem that they started with but there will be tens of thousands of Palestinians dead and probably thousands of Israelis as well and so the question is what is the political strategy that wraps around this military activity at the moment I see none what about the hostages Mike uh they're more than 200 hostages being held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip uh there's a lot of pressure on the Israeli government to bring them out alive obviously from other countries as well there are many foreign Nationals there uh how can Israel continue with its ground defensive and extract those hostages I I think it's very very difficult and again I I think we can what we can read into the Israeli actions and as you said other other governments who got their Nationals as hostages are putting great pressure on the Israelis but what I think we can read into the Israeli actions is that they don't care so much about the hostages the hostages are not their primary aim here their primary aim is to do damage to Hamas and I think on the side I think Netanyahu is politically in trouble in Israel so a ground offensive is a way of maintaining himself in power I think this the hostages are a secondary consideration I think we can take that analysis from looking at the Israeli actions if you were trying to get the hostages back you wouldn't be launching a ground Invasion what about the signals coming from other players in the region Mike because this conflict has hugely explosive potential for the region doesn't it it does and you know just over the last few days we we've seen eruan of Turkey um making comments to crowds in Istanbul about going into Gaza I mean obviously this is rhetoric is Iran as well with its proxies Hezbollah and others in the region so it it does have great potential for and really what the problem will come is is a mistake somebody will make a mistake there's so many players the situation is very ambiguous it's hard to tell what's going on we saw that with the the strike on the hospital last week but fake news whistles around all over the place and in those environments it's very easy for someone Iran America Israel turkey to make a mistake and then they've committed themselves to a much bigger conflict than than hither to and that's the problem that we face at the moment Mike thank you very much that was military analyst Mike Martin thank you"}, "-H0bfMfUxEc": {"url":

in and around Gaza that the Israeli forces are finding that they're coming up against anti-tank battalions they're also coming up against uh hang grades being thrown at them and landmines we know that one of their senior commanders of the armor Brigade has been killed he was a man that was regarded as a hero in Israel because of how he uh turned his troops round on the 7th of October and fought back against Hamas he has now died and this comes just a couple of days after the Israelis said that they killed hamas's main anti-tank organizer and they said that that this would make things easier as they move further into to the Gaza Strip but it's clear the urban fighting that they expected to to encounter it's there and and it's slowing their progress they might not be moving as fast as many

to find out what Israel's new military objectives are you remember that Anthony blinkin was here twice before the ground war actually started he will again reiterate his support for Israel and the right to defend themselves as long as they do it within international law both humanitarian law and the rules of war and he gave evidence on Capitol Hill earlier this week and we heard him say that there would be no ceasefire that that would be a benefit to Hamas there is some suggestion that he might call for a humanitarian pause but certainly given his comments earlier this week that seems unlikely now during that hearing he said that perhaps the uh Palestinian Authority could play an enhanced role in governing Gaza after the war well just in the last 30 minutes or so Hamas has released a statement saying it is rude and arant of the United States to try and suggest such a thing that they reject blatant attempts to intervene and impose a new regime in Gaza itself uh now we know that Anthony blinkin will meet with senior government figures here his intention then is to go to a man in Jordan where he'll meet uh King Abdullah there and then he will go to turkia and he will speak to uh the the president and and senior members of the turkia government there's always the possibility as we saw back in October that Anthony blinkin could add steps on to this visit but clearly his visit here uh his visit to Israel on Friday is going to be uh the most significant o of all his discussions all right we'll leave it there thanks so much Alan fiser well Alan liel is a former director general of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a former Israeli ambassador to South Africa joins us now from Tel Aviv good to have you with us so first of all do you think Benjamin netan has made the release of Israeli captives in Gaza a priority I think it is up on his agenda but naturally with the last days of fighting inside the Gaza strep all the focus is on the fighting but I think the Israeli government has it high on its agenda the families are acting also independently they have headquarters in Tel Aviv of the 232 families and they are reaching out to the world with the stories of the people in captivity and they trying to send up a message outside Israel and to the Israeli government that they think a a deal should be done fast and even using the term all for all so I'm in almost daily touch with families and trying to help the families as far as we can now over the last few days when we've been speaking and interviewing with Hamas officials they've said they would be willing to release the Israeli captives if Palestinian prisoners could be released if essential Goods could be allowed into Gaza and the bombing could be halted do you think that's something of a starting point at the very least that Israel could engage with if this government of Benjamin Netanyahu wanted I can first of all I'm not the Israeli government as you know and I don't speak on behalf of the Israeli government your perspective or your analysis and I can give you my feeling and the feelings of some of the families ER I think what we should try focus on is a the term all for all I think as you tie to the Daily fighting it is complicated thing complicating things but I think this term all for all should be H thoroughly examined and and the definitely the families are in favor of it and the families as you know have some cloud and the voice is being heard and I I think if we can disassociate H this uh preparations for an exchange from the daily fighting ER it will it might make it easier I'm glad you mentioned the the families because as we see an intensification of the air strikes on Gaza in what balum the Israeli Human Rights group called in its report a criminal policy of Revenge what Amnesty International said on October 19th that the air strikes were violations of international law as families see that this not only claims more and more Palestinian civilian lives but according to Hamas also the lives of some of the civilian Israeli captives is that pressure going to intensify in turn on the Israeli Prime Minister look again I'm taking the angle of the families and only the angle of the families and the families want the people in captivity released no definitions now they are very very worried as the fighting is inside Gaza and they guess their people are inside Gaza you can imagine how parents feel about their children and I just came from a meeting with them they want the people in captivity out and if it will be done in an exchange in an exchange the more we push into it all kind of definitions and all kind kind of additional conditions beyond the all for all it it will not happen even the all for all itself is complicated because you don't know who holds who and where and so on so I think I think and this is the feeling I get from the families that if H all Sites including the International Community will try to examine an all for all exchange we might make progress H if we push this issue of People in captivity into the overall picture it will be much more difficult to arrange any release or exchange all right we'll leave it there thanks so much for your thoughts on that thank you"}, "w_BUBTe258s": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_BUBTe258s", "video_id": "w_BUBTe258s", "description": "Israel

Israelis have been killed in hamas's military operation including some 286 Soldiers the combined death toll makes this conflict the deadliest on both sides of all five Gaza conflicts meanwhile

refugee agency evacuated its centers this video shows a paramedic responding to an attack in southern Gaza that's where Israel had ordered Palestinians to flee for their own safety Israel denied is targeting the area well let's get the latest now on the situation inside Gaza Jamila Abu Zuna joins us now on the phone from Kan yunes in the southern Gaza Strip Jamila I understand you live in Gaza City but you've had to flee with your own family and with so many others I'm glad that you're safe I understand you're now in a shelter in the South can you talk us through what conditions are like yes uh today is the third day uh of staying at a un shelter in the south of Gaza and Junes uh where now about 20,000 people are staying here and even more are coming are still coming um it's really it's after we have been forced to flee and evacuate our our houses our homes in Gaza and we went South not knowing what's going to happen later but as you said earlier uh it's happening they're launching a land attack is the next phase it's another 1948 uh uh diaspora so it's happening again the world is seeing this but still nothing is changing J my situation Sor I was just wanting to ask you said 20,000 people are Sheltering there with you Ian that's a huge number can you talk us through what what you're seeing there around you uh it's it's devastating to to try to describe actually um we've been sleeping on the floor literally uh we have no access to clean water no electricity um even no clean bathroom for instance uh even food is is very limited all the supplies are limited uh all and we have to mention that most of the people here of the people are uh infants children and elderly people who need urgent assistance medical assistance Jam we've also been hearing that there have been strikes on people as they've been fleeing the northern part of the Gaza Strip what do you know about that it's true uh yesterday one of the families who evacuated uh who came to the shelter we in they're saying that uh they evacuated the last minute and the other people who were fleeing uh after them were were completely um bombarded while they were on the way so it's not safe they say they're making SE ceas Fires for people to to um to give people chance to flee their home to the South but still there is no safety Jam Abu Zuna there Jamila please do stay safe with your family thank you for sharing that report with us we'll be staying in touch with you in the coming hours thank you jamala well Hamas is continuing to fire Rockets from Gaza into Southern Israel warning sirens have sounded across Israel with people in the coastal city of Tel Aviv and the surrounding towns they're taking shelter well let's now go to Al's Charles Stratford he's in sedot in southern Israel Charles there has been more movement by the Israeli military overnight what's been happening well just to bring you up to date where we are here in stot um I suppose the last half an hour or so it literally just stopped but some very heavy and sustained gunfire that we can hear we estimate probably around about a kilometer from here behind us towards the Gaza border the Gaza border is around 3 km nothing being said about this yet by the Israeli military but what we do know is that in recent days or since that initial attack on October the 7th the Israeli Army has been struggling to deal with repeated infiltration attempts by Palestinian fighters from Gaza that kind of firefight would suggest possibly well we can't confirm another infiltration attempt meanwhile we've heard a lot of outgoing uh we understand Heavy Artillery pounding areas of Gaza um from areas surrounding us here um and yes as you say there have been Rockets fired by that's another we understand outgoing um there have been Rockets fired overnight various different places and this morning um we heard Rockets being intercepted last night very loudly in Ash DOD as you you mentioned Tel Aviv also ashalon so yeah the situation remains obviously as you can imagine very unstable here but um it's small arms and heavy gun heavy machine gun fire like that so close to the border that as I say would suggest possible new infiltration attempts but we'll be able to confirm that later Charles we're hearing also about evacuations taking place around where you are what more can you tell us and also about the military buildup that we've been seeing towards the Border that's right the town of stot the mayor here is repeatedly called for an evacuation I think for all intents and purpose he might actually get what he wants today um around 25 to 30% of the population of stot are still here that's around 7,000 people I mean the streets are are pretty empty those 7,000 if indeed those statistics that we're understanding have been supplied To Us by the local authorities are true then as you can imagine most people are staying in their homes there are buses apparently being laid on collection points in this town we haven't seen any of those buses yet but we have spoken to people here um the few civilians that we've seen on the streets and some of them are saying some of them are looking for these buses and saying now is the time to get out and others are refusing to go we literally a few seconds a few minutes ago spoke to a man who passed us on his bicycle and said that um he uh he didn't want to go but he would possibly be forced to leave not by the military but because there was not much food left all the shops as you can imagine are closed it's a similar scenario in various towns um close to the Border as well an attempt by the military to evacuate the remaining civilians from these areas and meanwhile the military buildup continues um hundreds possibly thousands of Tanks APC heavy military equipment that is now moving into positions we understand possibly forward or more forward operational positions um some of the areas that we've seen equipment gathering in the last few days is now empty um and they have gone we understand into a closed military zone so all indications are that yes after last night's Announcement by the military that it was planning such a big offensive into Gaza it wouldn't be in conceivable if that offensive could start in the hours certainly the days ahead Charles there with the latest Forest on the ground and sederot in southern Israel

I'M ANNE-MARIE GREENE.  ISRAEL HAS ORDERED PEOPLE TO  EVACUATE IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS.  THE UNPRECEDENTED WARNING CAME  IN JUST BEFORE MIDNIGHT LAST  NIGHT.  THE UNITED NATIONS SAYS THAT IS  IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT DEVASTATING  HUMANITARIAN CONSEQUENCES.  HAMAS RESPONDED BY TELLING  CIVILIANS TO STAY PUT.  TOMORROW MARKS ONE WEEK SINCE  THE HORROR OF THIS WAR UNFOLDED  AND THIS NEW EVACUATION ORDER  COULD SIGNAL A GROUND INVASION  BY ISRAEL IS COMING.  ISRAELI OFFICIALS SAY THEY HAVE  DROPPED MORE THAN 6000 BOMBS  OVER THE PAST WEEK.  THE UN HAS WARNED OF A HUITAIN  MANTARIAN CATASTROPHE AFTER  ISRAEL CUT OFF GAZA'S SUPPLY OF  FOOD, FUEL AND ELECTRICITY.  THOUSANDS HAVE BEEN KILLED ON  BOTH SIDES, INCLINING 27  AMERICANS.  EARLIER TODAY DEFENSE SECRETARY  LLOYD AUSTIN ARRIVED IN THE  COUNTRY TO MEET WITH ISRAELI  PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN  NETANYAHU AND OTHER OFFICIALS  AND TO GET A LOOK AT SOME OF  THE WEAPONS AND RESOURCES THE  U.S. HAS SENT.  SECRETARY OF STATE ANTONY  BLINKEN IS HEADING TO QATAR  RIGHT NOW.  THEY FOCUSED ON EFFORTS TO  SECURE THE RELEASE OF HOSTAGES  AND WAYS TO PREVENT THE  CONFLICT FROM EXPANDING.  >> FIRST IT'S IMPORTANT TO STEP  BACK AND PUT THIS IN  PERSPECTIVE.  NO COUNTRY.  NO COUNTRY COULD TOLERATE  WHAT'S HAPPENED TO ISRAEL THAT  IS HAVING ITS CITIZENS  SLAUGHTERED BY A TERRORIST  GROUP.  ISRAEL IS NOT ONLY DOES IT HAVE  THE RIGHT, IT HAS THE  OBLIGATION TO DEFEND ITS PEOPLE  AND TO DO WHAT IT CAN TO TRY TO  MAKE SURE THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN  AGAIN.  ISRAEL HAS TO MAKE HARD  DECISIONS ABOUT THE BEST WAY TO  DO THAT.  THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO DO  THAT.  WEWE'RE SUPPORTING THEM.  WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THEY  HAVE WHAT THEY NEED TO DEFEND  THEIR PEOPLE AND TO AVOID A  REPEAT OF WHAT'S HAPPENED.  >> IAN LEE IS JOINING US NOW  FOR MORE.  IAN, YOU HEARD THE UN REPORTS  THAT ISRAEL'S MILITARY HAS  INFORMED THEM THAT MORE THAN A  MILLION PALESTINIANS IN GAZA  SHOULD RELOCATE FROM THE NORTH  TO THE SOUTH WITHIN 24 HOURS AS  WE POINTED OUT THIS MESSAGE  CAME OUT AT MIDNIGHT THEIR  TIME.  HOURS HAVE ALREADY GONE BY.  HAMAS IS TELLING CIVILIANS TO  STAY PUT.  CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT'S  HAPPENING?  >> Reporter: YEAH, ANNE-MARIE.  WE HEARD FROM THE ISRAELI  MILITARY THERE'S GOING TO BE  SIGNIFICANT FORCE USED AFTER  THAT 24 HOUR PERIOD.  WARNING ROUGHLY A MILLION  GAZANS TO FLEE FROM THE  NORTHERN PART OF THAT COASTAL  STRIP SOUTH.  THAT'S EASIER SAID THAN DONE.  THERE ISN'T THE INFRASTRUCTURE  FOR THAT MANY PEOPLE TO MOVE  SOUTH AND IF THEY WERE TO MOVE  SOUTH, WHERE WOULD THEY GO?  THERE IS NO PLACE TO GO.  EGYPT ISN'T GOING TO OPEN UP  ITS BORDER.  THERE'S NOT ENOUGH  INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THOSE PEOPLE  TO GO.  THE SAFEST PLACE FOR CIVILIANS  TO BE ARE THESE UN SCHOOLS.  THESE ARE DESIGNATED SAFETY  ZONES BY ISRAEL, BY THE UN, BY  THE PALESTINIANS.  PLACES WHERE CIVILIANS CAN FIND  REFUGE.  WE KNOW THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF  THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN THESE  SCHOOLS RIGHT NOW.  BUT THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS  SITUATION FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE  NORTH IN GAZA CITY BECAUSE IF  THEY CAN'T GET TO ONE OF THESE  SCHOOLS, THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE  ANYWHERE ELSE TO GO.  HAMAS IS TELLING PEOPLE TO STAY  PUT THAT THIS IS ALL PART OF  THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE OF  ISRAEL.  THE UN SAYS THIS IS GOING TO  LEAD TO CATASTROPHE.  IF YOU'RE A CIVILIAN IN THE  NORTHERN PART OF GAZA YOU'RE  LOOKING AT THIS AND WONDERING  WHERE CAN I TAKE MY FAMILY TO  MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE SAFE AND  REALLY NO GOOD ANSWERS AT THIS  MOMENT.  >> THERE ISN'T.  ONE POSSIBILITY COULD HAVE BEEN  EGYPT BUT TALK OF A SAFE  CORRIDOR TO EGYPT FOR REFEW  GEES SEEMS TO BE A NO GO.  EGYPTIAN SECURITY SOURCES SAY  THEY'RE REJECTING ANY MOVE TO  DO SO.  WHAT'S GOING ON?  >> Reporter: YEAH.  IDENTIFY BEEN BASED IN EGYPT  FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AS WELL.  I'VE BEEN TO THAT BORDER  CROSSING.  IT IS A TIGHT MILITARY ZONE.  EGYPT IS HAPPY TO SEND SUPPLIES  IN TO GAZA, BUT THEY REALLY  HAVE NEVER EVEN IN ALL THE WARS  THAT HAVE HAPPENED IN GAZA LET  A STREAM OF REFUGEES INTO THEIR  COUNTRY.  THEY DON'T WANT THAT  HUMANITARIAN CRISIS TO SHOW UP  ON THEIR TERRITORY.  THAT'S WHY THEY DON'T REALLY  GET GAZANS INSIDE THEIR COUNTRY  AND SO THAT DOES CREATE THAT  CONUNDRUM FOR WHERE DO THEY GO.  WHERE CAN THEY FIND THAT  SAFETY?  >> HAMAS MEAN TIME HAS CLAIMED  13 HOSTAGES BEING HELD HAVE  BEEN KILLED IN THE PAST DAY BY  ISRAELI AIR STRIKES.  WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THAT?  >> Reporter: YEAH, HAMAS IS  SAYING THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER  OF FOREIGNERS PART OF THOSE 13  PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED.  YOU KNOW, THIS IS A REALLY  DIFFICULT SITUATION FOR THE  ISRAELIS BECAUSE ONCE THOSE  PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED  LIKELY THEY'RE DISPERSED  THROUGHOUT THE GAZA STRIP.  HAMAS HAS BEEN ABLE TO HOLD  HOSTAGES BEFORE AND KEEP THEM  IN UNDISCLOSED LOCATIONS REALLY  WHERE NO ONE KNOWS, NOT EVEN  ISRAELIS CAN FIGURE OUT WHERE  THEY ARE.  YOU DO HAVE THAT POSSIBILITY  THAT AS ISRAEL CARRIES OUT  THESE DEVASTATING AIR STRIKES,  THOUSANDS OF THEM, THAT  HOSTAGES COULD BE HOLED UP IN  THESE HAMAS AREAS.  COULD BE KILLED.  SO THIS IS A CALCULUS THAT  ISRAELI MILITARY OFFICIALS ARE  GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE WHEN  STRIKING THOSE TARGETS IN GAZA.  >> YOU KNOW, VERY EARLY ON  SHORTLY AFTER THE INITIAL  ATTACK ON SATURDAY I WAS  WONDERING WHERE THE PALESTINIAN  AUTHORITY WAS IN THIS.  WHY HAD WE NOT HEARD FROM THEM.  EVENTUALLY A STATEMENT WAS  RELEASED BUT NOW WE'RE LEARNING  THAT U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE  ANTONY BLINKEN MET WITH THE  PRESIDENT OF THE PALESTINIAN  AUTHORITY MAHMOUD ABBAS IN  JORDAN.  WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THAT  MEETING?  >> Reporter: YEAH, THE  PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY HAS  PRETTY MUCH TAKEN BY SURPRISE  LIKE EVERYONE WAS BY THAT HAMAS  ATTACK.  BUT THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY  IS THE VOICE OF THE PALESTINIAN  PEOPLE OR AT LEAST THE  INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED  VOICE OF THE PALESTINIAN  PEOPLE.  MAHMOUD ABBAS BEING THE  PRESIDENT.  MEETING WITH HIM IS IMPORTANT  FOR THE UNITED STATES, NOT ONLY  TO DISCUSS THE ON GOING  CONFLICT BUT TO TRY TO FIND A  WAY OUT OF IT TO GET THE  PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY ON BOARD.  BUT WE ARE GOING TO LIKELY HEAR  FROM THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY  THAT THEY WANT TO SEE CONCRETE   PEACE PROCESS.  THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS  REALLY NOT EXISTED IN OVER A  DECADE. AND SO THIS WAR IS REAL  CHANGING THE CALCULUS.  RIGHT NOW IT IS WAGING THAT WAR  THAT WE'RE SEEING FROM ISRAELIS  AND HAMAS.  >> IAN LEE, THANK YOU.  >>> THE UNITED STATES IS MOVING  AHEAD WITH PLANS TO GET TRAPPED  AMERICAN CITIZENS OUT OF ISRAEL  AS EARLY AS TODAY.

DEEPLY.  WE HAVE TO COMMUNICATE TO THE  WORLD THIS IS CRITICAL.  THIS IS NOT EVEN HUMAN  BEHAVIOR.  IT'S PURE BARBERRISM.

carrying out raids inside Gaza the military says infantry and tank units entered to track down rocket Crews destroy weapons and search for hostages the raids do not appear to be the beginning of an expected ground offensive Israel has masked troops and tanks along the Gaza border DW correspondent Rebecca rers is in Tela she told us more about this Israeli raids on Gaza well that is what we've been hearing the Israeli military saying that they have been carrying out these very small very targeted very elite teams have been going in and carrying out uh these raids as you said in the lead in there to try particularly I think to look for uh some of the more than 100 hostages we know are being held in Gaza uh this is the first shift really towards a ground Invasion though as you also mentioned not a an indicative of the beginning of such a ground Invasion though that is something that is largely expected to happen in the coming days if not week we've been seeing uh I was down there this week myself been seeing very very uh heavy Armament and and a huge troop movement around that Gaza border and it is thought by everyone though we've had no confirmation from the Israeli military but it is thought that a ground Invasion would be the next step so it isn't surprising that this interim step is a way that they can enter try and look for these hostages and and do other targeted acts in there without triggering the full ground Invasion at this stage twws Rebecca rers in t there now thousands of people are attempting to flee their homes in gaza's North the Israeli military has given over 1 million people just 24 hours to evacuate South the United Nations has called the order impossible and the terror group Hamas is telling people to stay in their homes but many Gins have decided to risk the journey before a possible Invasion Michael oh handland a senior fellow for foreign policy at the Brookings institution in Washington thank you for joining us Michael I want to start by asking you about Israel's military calling these localized trades do you see them as a first step in a ground Invasion and what does localized trades mean at this point greetings well I thought your coverage was very correct to say that they're looking for certain things and including hostages obviously once they go in and mass with a big Force they know the hostages lives are at even greater Peril and so if there's any hope whatsoever of finding those hostages it makes sense to try to do it beforehand however this is very hard work to find people like needles in a hay stack to find individuals whether Israeli or Hamas leaders or Hamas holding the Israelis because you just don't have a lot of ways to find these individuals you can try you can hope you might know their cell phone numbers or be able to recognize their voices or otherwise have some kind of a Telltale signature but it's not that hard to just find a basement or an apartment and put people there and there's no particular way modern technology can find a hostage or a Hamas leader just based on you know their Identity or their DNA so it's going to take some luck to be able to find anything useful with these limited incursions Israel has been watching the Gaza Strip for years obviously and so they may have some places where they suspect activity's been ongoing where Hamas tends to do uh its most important work or have a lot of its key assets but Hamas is relatively unlikely to put hostages in those places so I think Israel's probably not going to make a lot of Headway in these initial efforts but it makes sense to try because it may be the best hope for getting anyone out of there alive it's interesting to me that you used that analogy of needles in a haast stack because we also talking about an area that is very densely populated and it's an Urban Terrain that is amongst the most densely populated in the world is it given these circumstances even possible for Israel's military to avoid massive civilian casualties if this so-called ground offensive is carried out soon is it's going to be awfully hard and this is of course why Israel has asked or demanded that more than a million Palestinians in the northern part of the Gaza Strip relocate it's a Preposterous claim at one level how could they possibly all relocate how could you ever expect that Hamas would let them and yet if they don't they're going to be in the crosshairs of an operation that does not know exactly where it's headed I don't think the Israelis they have some initial targets I'm sure within Gaza beyond that I believe they're hoping that one target leads to another they gain intelligence as they proceed but it's going to have to be you know it's going to have to be human intelligence work which is always painstaking slow and imperfect and requires good sources to be done well I don't know how many Palestinians are going to want to talk to the Israeli Army that's about to enter into Gaza so my overall concern is that the Israelis are not going to be able to do very well at finding what they really want except through Brute Force building byb building searches which means that there will be a lot of firefights there'll be people with itchy trigger fingers there'll be ambushes set up by Hamas that Israel will respond to inocent people will get caught up in the crossfire Israel sometimes will think that it's being ambushed Israeli soldiers will feel that way even if they're not it's going to be an extraordinarily intense and uh unfortunately quite lethal Battleground I'm afraid in in in the coming weeks that sounds like a really difficult situation for everybody involved to navigate and I may be speaking a bit too soon but if these are the circumstances the military will be dealing with at what point can they call for a conclusion to this kind of an offensive what is the main goal at the end here that will make them end such an offensive the main goal I believe is the overthrow of Hamas now we all know prime minister Netanyahu has famously said that if you're a member of Hamas he will die and that's sort of an understandable human emotional reaction to what just happened to his fellow Israelis but I'm not sure it's a realistic military objective and I'm not sure it needs to be but I think what Israel is going to try to do is make sure that Hamas is no longer in charge of the Gaza Strip that itself is going to be a difficult objective to achieve but I think that's the more realistic goal and what they will be trying to do therefore is locate the maximum number of top Hamas leadership top Hamas command and control sites any kind of financial assets Hamas has the weapon that Hamas has and also just to be honest to be blunt create enough pain for everyone not through intentional taking of civilian life but through an operation that will lead to a lot of uh loss of life on all sides that at some point Hamas can be persuaded either to step down or to otherwise allow an international supervision of the rule of Gaza going forward I think that's where this those are the parameters of the conversations that you and I and others will be having over the next two or three weeks because you're right it's too soon to know right we're going to have to see what happens on the Battleground before we can really know but these are the kinds of negotiations and compromises and parameters for you know adjustment that one could expect to see emerge thank you for that analysis Michael handland from The Brookings institution thank you let's take a quick look at some other news concerning the conflict turkey has begun sending humanitarian Aid intended for Gaza two Turkish Air Force planes have brought food and medical supplies into Egypt the raar border crossing is in southern Gaza is the only point where eight can be delivered an artillery strike has killed a journalist and injured six others in southern Lebanon Isam Abdullah of the Reuters news agency was covering clashes on the border with Israel un Secretary General Antonio gutes warn the attack highlights the risk of the conflict spilling over German president Frank Walter Stein meire called for solidarity with Jews during a visit to a synagogue in Berlin he said the state must protect Jewish life after the Hamas terrorist group urged violence against Jewish communities Stein meire said he represents the whole nation at the side of all Jews in Germany US Secretary of State anony lincol has wrapped up talks in Qatar he's been traveling around the region in in an attempt to prevent the conflict widening he began in Israel to show support and discuss hostage negotiations linkoln also met the Palestinian president in Jordan he says it's vital to contain the violence United States and cutter share the goal of preventing this conflict from spreading uh we discussed in detail our efforts to prevent any actor state or non-state from creating a new front uh in this conflict we're also working intensively together to secure the release of hostages including American citizens being held by Hamas and Gaza I'm grateful for the urgency that qter is bringing to this effort let's get more on that with tww special correspondent a Ibraham in Washington it's good to see you a did Lincoln give any more details on how Qatar is helping contain this conflict it is expected that that with qatar's sort of special connections with Hamas a a group that is designated as a terror organization by the US and others but obviously not in Qatar that Qatar can help with hostage negotiations in uh the first uh as a as as a first priority as secretary blinkin and uh President Biden have uh reiterated again and again in in in the days um in the past couple of days that the release of hostages really is a uh priority he's also hoping I mean this is part of you know he's on kind of on a worldwind tour of the region at the moment he's hoping that Qatar can also help with the deescalation effects Qatar has uh not only relationships with Hamas but also relationships with the Iranian regime uh and so there's this is definitely also about deescalation as well as uh maybe helping with hostage negotiations when we speak about deescalation we know that in that press conference we just saw blinken in and he also fielded questions on the humanitarian situation in Gaza how did he respond to those well he did reiterate Israel's right to defend itself uh in the face of these unprecedented uh attacks he said that it is a priority or that he has brought it up with Israeli partners that uh Israel has to also consider civilian life in uh conducting uh these uh attacks pardon in conducting this military uh uh operation he said that there's also an emphasis on finding humanitarian uh corridors uh for civilians within the Gaza Strip uh but he was he was asked specifically about the evacuation order that was given to civilians in Gaza but he did not give any details about whether or not uh he approves or condones uh uh that that particular evacuation order so some careful wording from the secretary of state of the US there but we are seeing him on as you mentioned this Whirlwind tour what exactly is he trying to achieve here through that right we're seeing him um you know he was in Bahrain today in Qatar he's expected to also be in Saudi Arabia and he has been to Jordan and has met with the Palestinian Authority there and that is really in an in an effort to get also players in the region to condemn the terror attacks that took place uh in Israel but also in an effort to deescalate the situation A Ibraham in Washington DC following that story for us of anti blin trip through the Middle East thank you so much a"}, "TPDSbBydLW4": {"url":

a terrorist attack Israeli air strikes hit a house in central Gaza Strip Sunday afternoon Reports say at least six people were killed the injured are rush to the hospital as neighbors and Medics duck to find survivors in Rafa in southern Gaza many homes were also hit by Israeli strikes 10 houses were destroyed with children between 2 and 5 years old were they Fighters if they're looking for Fighters they're on the borders not in safe zones Israel has stepped up its bombardment of Gaza saying its hitting targets connected to Hamas terrorists and other militant groups to the residents of Gaza City and north of Gaza City you see that we intensified our attacks and we will continue acting like that so move South a request many have heated but even the South isn't safe from Israeli strikes the UN says over 60% of gaza's population has been displaced and many are taking refuge in camps like these lacking basic facilities civilians face widespread shortages of clean water fuel medicines and food in the southern city of Khan yunes people have to wait for hours to buy [Applause] bread we've been here at the bakery's door since Dawn only God knows our suffering if the situation continues the same way for two or three more days it will be a catastrophe in the Gaza Strip children are starving we ask all countries and Nations to look at us with some Humanity drug getting basic supplies have finally reached Gaza from Egypt but the eight Falls far short of what is needed the most urgent needs at the moment are fuel water food and Medicine why fuel because fuel is used to produce water in Gaza there is no drinking water in Gaza and fuel is used to run the salination plans so it's very very very important and so far no fuel has been allowed into Gaza and without more urgently needed supplies the humanitarian crisis can only get worse and for more on that agreement to let more Aid into Gaza I spoke to DW's Tanya Kramer in the Israeli city of ashod near [Music] Gaza well I mean it has been trickling in now on Saturday in sundon but uh as we heard in the report it's far from being enough to cover the needs of the 2.2 million people living in Gaza the civilian population so we understand that there has been another phone call between US President Joe Biden and the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the readout it says that they agreed to allow the continuous flow of humanitarian Aid into Gaza it's not specified how much that would be how often that would be and what it would be there's still a disp about fuel as well because that is needed of course hospitals are saying they're running out to operate their generators both also of course generators are needed uh to operate water pumps Etc so uh this is very much needed um so that has not been coming in because uh for almost two weeks we're now going into the third week of this War uh all the border crossings had been uh closed we also understand there's significant opposition in Israel by some of the groups from the far right we've heard that they don't want any humanitarian Aid going in as well from some of the families of the hostages that say there should be no humanitarian Aid going in if there are no hostages being released and indeed this is all taking place across the backdrop of Israel's military increasing its strikes on Gaza um what has the defense Ministry been saying about the next phase of the war well Army officials here have been saying that they intensify uh the already very massive uh campaign of air strikes uh on Gaza and we've seen this also uh from Sunday onwards um we are still waiting everybody is still waiting for the ground uh offensive uh to happen that troops go in there has been an incident on Sunday where apparently some Israeli soldiers went inside Gaza uh one uh uh Soldier was killed uh the isra the Hamas militant Hamas group military Wing the kasan Brigade said that Ambush them uh so this is uh certainly of concern to the Israeli army they have also been called to people in the north of Gaza again those who have been staying there to leave and go to the South this is very controversial obviously because people are saying you know whether we go to the South or we staying in our homes we don't want to be displaced because there also have been massive air strikes in the south on runis on Rafa on other places so it's not safe to go there this is what people there are saying and we also heard from the defense minister YF galland he said you know a ground Invasion could could last for one two or three months but the end goal would be that Hamas there's an end to Hamas but of course nobody talks about the political implications what will Gaza look like what it means uh on the political terms now on Sunday uh Netanyahu visited troops stationed near the border with Lebanon can you tell us a little bit about what the situation is like there well also there the situation has been seeing more crossb fire uh between uh the lianes shared militant group Hezbollah but also other militant Palestinian groups there you know anti-tank fire missiles and Israel has also been responding to that so there is a lot of concern uh that there might be another front opening uh there at the moment it seems to be kind of contained if you can say that but uh the the uh crossb fire has been intensifying uh there as well and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has now issued again yesterday a Stern warning tobah that it would be a mistake if they would seek to enter War but of course military correspondents here also saying no there could be a miscalculation this is intensifying over the past days and something could happen out of there Israel could also opt to have a preemptive strike so we don't know what the strategy is there but we also understand that again Israel has called on more community unities in the sou in the North of Israel to evacuate towards the center uh of the of the country Tanya thank you so much for reporting that is Tanya Kramer for us there and we're now joined by Israeli military spokesperson Peter leoner welcome back to DW we understand the IDF has intensified its air strikes on Gaza can you tell me how many targets you have hit in the past 24 hours and how that compares to previous days give us a sense of the scale here yeah I'd like just to be a bit more accurate are we are intens intensifying our attacks on Hamas the terrorist organization that launched war against Israel on the 7th of October indeed we are conducting hundreds of strikes every day against the infrastructure that they have positioned pre-positioned and embedded within the civilian Arena putting at the the entire population of Gaza at risk We are continuing to call to the people of Gaza and specifically the northern Gaza strip to evacuate towards the south in order to try and keep them out of Harm's Way while we root out Hamas so in these uh strikes that the Israeli Army has been carrying out over the past two weeks what impact have they had on hamas's capabilities indeed we see uh Hamas in a state of disarray we see them in a situation where they have no idea what what is going on U mostly because they are hiding they are cowards they are hiding and they are trying to sacrifice the people of Gaza we are destroying the command and control positions we are killing their terrorist leaders from and and targeting the leaders who perpetrated planned and executed the attack of 7th of October um and that is it is showing itself and we are seeing a decline in their ability to launch rockets against us and indeed we have a full intention to destroy hamas's capability and making sure they can never ever use the Gaza as a staging ground for attacks against Israel and the people of Israel again now the Palestinian Health Ministry says at least 4,600 people are dead uh three times as many wounded how many of these were Hamas militants um hamas's propaganda Ministry of Health says that U we need to be very very cautious at accepting I would say even relying on any sources coming out of Gaza specific spefically hamas's Ministries um so I won't suggest that there is any reason to actually comment on what Hamas is saying indeed we are conducting strikes number for us I no I would not even comment on that number I would say there is a reality on the ground in Gaza where Hamas has prepositioned its capabilities within the civilian Arena when they put uh explosive uh drones on the roofs of housetops they are jeopardizing that those housetops we are operating within the realm of the laws of armed conflict we are calling for people to evacuate areas to get them out of Harm's Way as a temporary me measure and Hamas is trying to keep them In Harm's Way and sacrifice them okay so while you weigh on and AC accept for face value what Hamas is telling you because of these numbers we need to be very very cautious because this is an organization that has no problem in butchering babies in their bedrooms so why would they have a problem in lying to the world media okay we'll leave it there thank you Peter Lerner from the IDF good day"}, "ewkb3CUa2Dg":

ON YOUR SCREEN RIGHT THERE IS  ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN  NETANYAHU ADDRESSING THE NATION  IN THE WORLD.  LET'S LISTEN IN.  >> ISRAEL WILL FIGHT.  SINCE OCTOBER 7, ISRAEL HAS  BEEN AT WAR.   ISRAEL DID NOT START THIS WAR .  ISRAEL DID NOT WANT THIS WAR .  BUT ISRAEL WILL WIN THIS WAR.  HAMAS  ONCE THIS WAR AND  LAUNCHED IT BY PERPETRATING THE  WORST SAVAGE OF PEOPLE SINCE  THE HOLOCAUST.  HOLOCAUST MURDER PEOPLE IN  FRONT OF THEIR PARENTS, MURDER  PARENTS IN FRONT OF THEIR  CHILDREN.  THEY BURNED PEOPLE ALIVE.  THEY RAPED  WOMEN.  THEY BEHEADED MEN.  THEY TORTURED HOLOCAUST  SURVIVORS, THEY KIDNAPPED  BABIES.  THEY COMMITTED THE MOST  HORRIFIC CRIMES IMAGINABLE.  THEY ARE PART OF THE EXCESSIVE  EVIL IRAN HAS FORMED, AN AXIS  OF TERROR THAT WORKS BY ARMING,  RAINING AND FINANCING H  AND GAZA, HEZBOLLAH AND LEBANON, YEMEN AND OTHER TERROR PROXIES  THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST AND  BEYOND THE MIDDLE EAST.  FIGHTING HAMAS AND THE IRANIAN  AXIS OF TERROR, ISRAEL IS  FIGHTING THE ENEMIES OF  CIVILIZATION ITSELF.   VICTORY OVER THOSE BEGINS WITH  MORE CLARITY.  IT BEGINS WITH KNOWING THE  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GOOD AND  EVIL, BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG.  IT MEANS MAKING A MORAL  DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE  DELIBERATE MURDER OF THE  INNOCENT AND THE UNINTENTIONAL  CASUALTIES THAT ACCOMPANY EVERY  LEGITIMATE WAR, EVEN THE MOST  JUST WAR.  IT MEANS HOLDING HAMAS  RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WAR CRIMES  IT COMMITS EVERY DAY BY  DELIBERATELY TARGETING ISRAELI  CIVILIANS OR DELIBERATELY USING  SHIELDS.  IT MEANS MAKING CLEAR THAT THE  USE OF HUMAN SHIELDS IS NOT  ONLY AN AMERICAN MORAL TACTIC  OF TERROR, BUT ALSO AN  INEFFECTIVE ONE.  BECAUSE AS LONG AS HAMAS IS  USING PALESTINIANS AS HUMAN  SHIELDS, WE SAW THE   INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY BLAMING  ISRAEL.  HAMAS WILL CONTINUE TO USE THAT  AS A TOOL OF TERROR AND SO WILL  OTHERS.  HAMAS WILL CONTINUE TO USE  PATIENTS IN GAZA'S HOSPITALS AS  THE COMMAND POST OF ITS VAST  TERROR NETWORK.  WILL CONTINUE TO USE MY AS  FORTIFIED MILITARY POSITIONS  AND WEAPON TO.  IT WILL CONTINUE TO STEEL FUEL  AND HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE  FROM  CIVILIANS.  ISRAEL IS DOING EVERYTHING TO  GET PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS OUT  UPON'S WAY, HAMAS IS DOING  EVERYTHING TO KEEP PALESTINIAN  CIVILIANS IN MONDAY'S WAY.  ISRAEL URGES PALESTINIAN  CIVILIANS TO LEAVE THE AREAS   WHILE HAMAS PREVENTS THEM FROM  LEAVING THOSE AREAS AT GUNPOINT. HAMAS IS ALSO PREVENTING  FOREIGN NATIONALS FROM LEAVING  GAZA ALTOGETHER.  MOST DESPICABLY, HAMAS IS  HOLDING OVER 200 ISRAELI  HOSTAGES, INCLUDING 33  CHILDREN.  HOLDING THE, TERRORIZING THEM,  KEEPING THEM AS HOSTAGES.  EVERY CIVILIZED NATION SHOULD  STAND WITH ISRAEL IN DEMANDING  THAT THESE HOSTAGES BE FREED  IMMEDIATELY AND FREED  UNCONDITIONALLY.   I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR ISRAEL  SAYS POSITION REGARDING HIS  CEASE-FIRE.  JUST AS THE UNITED STATES WOULD  NOT AGREE TO A CEASE-FIRE AFTER  THE BOMBING OF PEARL HARBOR, OR  AFTER THE TERRORIST ATTACKS OF  9/11, ISRAEL WILL NOT AGREE TO   THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES  WITH HAMAS AFTER THE HORRIFIC  ATTACKS OF OCTOBER 7. CALLS FOR  A CEASE-FIRE ARE CALLS FOR  ISRAEL TO SURRENDER TO HAMAS, \u00fa  SURRENDER TO VIOLENCE.  THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN.   LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE BIBLE  SAYS THERE IS A TIME FOR PEACE  AND A TIME FOR WAR. THIS IS A  TIME FOR WAR.  A WAR FOR OUR COMMON FUTURE.  TODAY WE DRAW A LINE BETWEEN  THE FORCES OF CIVILIZATION AND  THE FORCES OF BARBARY.  IT IS A TIME FOR EVERYONE TO  DECIDE WHERE THEY STAND.  ISRAEL WILL STAND AGAINST THE  FORCES OF BARBARISM UNTIL  VICTORY.  I HOPE AND PRAY THAT CIVILIZED  NATIONS EVERYWHERE  WILL BACK  THIS FIGHT BECAUSE ISRAEL SAYS  FIGHT IS YOUR FIGHT.  IF HAMAS'  AND IRAN'S AXIS OF  EVIL WIN, YOU WILL BE NEXT.  THAT IS WHY ISRAEL SAYS VICTORY  IS YOUR VICTORY.  MAKE NO MISTAKE.  REGARDLESS OF WHO STANDS WITH  ISRAEL, ISRAEL WILL FIGHT UNTIL  THIS BATTLE  IS WON.  ISRAEL WILL PREVAIL.   MAY GOD BLESS ISRAEL AND MAY  GOD BLESS  ALL THOSE WHO STAND  WITH ISRAEL.   >> THE FIRST QUESTION WILL GO TO NEWS 18 INDIA. PLEASE TAKE THE  MICROPHONE, SIR.  >> Reporter: GOOD EVENING, SIR.  >> GOOD EVENING.  >> Reporter: I AM FROM INDIA.  MY QUESTION TO YOU IS THAT HOW  DO YOU SEE INDIA TO STAND  BECAUSE THERE WAS NO  CONDEMNATION OF TERRORISM?  >> I THINK THAT RESOLUTION WAS  DEEPLY FLAWED.  I WAS SORRY TO SEE THAT EVEN  MANY OF OUR FRIENDS DID NOT  INSIST THERE WOULD BE A FULL  AND POWERFUL CONDEMNATION OF  THE HORRORS THAT WERE COMMITTED  HERE, HORRORS THAT NO CIVILIZED  COUNTRY, INCLUDING YOUR COUNTRY  AND SO MANY OTHERS WOULD  TOLERATE.  SO I HOPE THAT WE DON'T SEE A  REPEAT OF THESE KINDS OF  RESOLUTIONS.  >> WE WILL NOW GO TO ABC,  AMERICA.  >> Reporter: THANK YOU, SIR.  IT SEEMS THAT THE LEVEL OF  SUPPORT THAT YOU HAVE AMONG THE  ISRAELI PUBLIC HAS DROPPED  CONSIDERABLY.  THE QUESTION IS, HOW CAN YOU  CONTINUE TO LEAD THIS COUNTRY  EFFECTIVELY DURING A VERY  DIFFICULT TIME.  HAVE YOU AT ALL CONSIDERED  STEPPING DOWN?  >> THE ONLY THING I INTEND TO  HAVE RESIGNED IS HAMAS.  WE WILL RESIGNED THEM TO THE  DUSTBIN OF HISTORY.  THAT IS MY GOAL.  THAT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY.  THAT IS WHAT I AM DOING TO LEAD  THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL.  THIS IS MY RESPONSIBILITY NOW.  IT IS SOMETHING I THINK UNITES  THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.  WE ARE ALL SUPPORTING THE  SOLDIERS.  THE SOLDIERS ARE SUPPORTING  COMMANDERS.   WE ARE SUPPORTING THE IDF.  I THINK WE ARE SUPPORTING THE  UNBELIEVABLE EFFORTS OF OUR  RESERVISTS AND OUR SECURITY  FORCES.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT  UNTIL VICTORY.  >> Reporter: GOOD EVENING, SIR.  CHANNEL 2, GERMAN TELEVISION.  I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU, THERE  IS A WIDESPREAD DISCUSSION,  ESPECIALLY AMONG THE RELATIVES  OF THE HOSTAGES ABOUT THE CAUSE  OF MILITARY ACTION YOU HAVE  TAKEN SO FAR.  THE QUESTION IS, IS THIS THE  ONLY WAY TO FREE THE HOSTAGES?  OF COURSE, YOU ARE SUCCESSFUL  IN FREEING ONE HOSTAGE ON  SUNDAY BUT THERE IS WIDESPREAD  CRITICISM THIS DOES NOT ALLOW A  PLACE FOR OTHER NEGOTIATIONS.  WHAT DO YOU EXPLAIN TO THE  RELATIVES OF THE HOSPITAL  DOCTORS HOSTAGES RELYING ON  THIS?  >> I MET TWICE WITH THE  FAMILIES OF THE HOSTAGES.  YOU FELT THEIR ANGUISH.  I FELT THEIR ANGUISH.  I KNOW THE SENSE, IT IS NOT  ONLY A SENSE OF LOSS, THE GRIEF  THE PARENTS HAVE, IT IS A SENSE  OF NOT KNOWING, OF CONTINUOUS,  CONTINUOUS ANGUISH.  I FULLY UNDERSTAND THEIR  CONCERN.  OUR COMMON ASSESSMENT OF ALL OF  THAT, NOT ONLY THE CABINET  MEMBERS BUT THE SECURITY FORCES  AND THE MILITARY IS THAT THE  GROUND ACTION ACTUALLY CREATES  THE POSSIBILITY, THAT THE  CERTAINTY, BUT THE POSSIBILITY,  OF GETTING HOSTAGES OUT BECAUSE  HAMAS WILL NOT DO IT UNLESS  THEY ARE UNDER PRESSURE.  THEY SIMPLY WILL NOT DO IT.  THEY ONLY DO IT UNDER PRESSURE.  THIS CREATES PRESSURE.  AGAIN, WE OBVIOUSLY GREETED ONE  HOSTAGE WITH OPEN ARMS AFTER  YESTERDAY'S SUCCESSFUL ACTION  BY THE IDF BUT WE ARE COMMITTED  TO GETTING ALL THE HOSTAGES  BACK HOME.  WE THINK THIS METHOD STANDS A  CHANCE.  WE ARE COMMITTED TO IT.  >> AUSTRALIA, CHRIS.  >> Reporter: I AM FROM CHANNEL  7, AUSTRIA.  I WANT TO ASK A QUESTION FROM  MY COUNTRY.  THE PEOPLE IN MY COUNTRY ARE  WONDERING, THEY AGREE WITH YOU,  THEY WANT YOU TO CHASE DOWN  HAMAS AND TERRORISM AND DESTROY  TERRORISM IN THIS REGION, ET  CETERA.  PEOPLE CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY SO  MANY PEOPLE, CIVILIANS, HAVE TO  DIE IN THE PROCESS.  YOU ARGUE THAT HAMAS HAS BEEN  USING THEM AS HUMAN SHIELDS.  IS THAT A GOOD ENOUGH EXCUSE?  ARE YOU EFFECTIVE HERE.  ARE YOU ISSUING COLLECTIVE  PUNISHMENT ON THE PEOPLE OF  PALESTINE?  >> NOT A SINGLE CIVILIAN HAS TO  DIE.  HAMAS MERELY NEARS -- NEEDS TO  LET THEM GO TO THE SAFE ZONE  THAT WE CREATED.  THERE IS A SAFE ZONE. NOT A  SINGLE CIVILIAN HAS TO DIE.  HAMAS IS PREVENTING THEM FROM  LEAVING, KEEPING THEM IN THE  AREAS OF CONFLICT.  I THINK YOU SHOULD DIRECT YOUR  QUESTIONS TO HAMAS.  I CAN TELL YOU ONE THING.  WE ARE GOING OUT OF OUR WAY TO  PREVENT CIVILIAN CASUALTIES.  NOT ONLY BY ASKING CIVILIANS TO  MOVE, CALLING ON THEM TO MOVE,  RANGING A PLACE FOR THEM TO BE,  WHICH IS SAFE, ALSO PUTTING IN  HUMANITARIAN SUPPORT, PROVIDING  THEM WITH THE MEANS, WITH FOOD,  WITH WATER, WITH MEDICINE AND  SO ON.  I THINK THAT THIS QUESTION  SHOULD BE PLACED ON HAMAS.  THE MORE IT IS PLACED ON  ISRAEL, THE MORE YOU WILL SEE  THIS REPEATED AGAIN AND AGAIN  AND AGAIN.   OTHER GROUPS, OTHER CRIMINAL  ORGANIZATIONS WILL USE  CIVILIANS AS HUMAN SHIELDS.  WE CANNOT GET IN A POSITION TO  GIVE IMMUNITY TO THESE  TERRORISTS.  WE CANNOT GIVE IMMUNITY TO THE  SAVAGES.  WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN  TO MINIMIZE CIVILIAN  CASUALTIES, BUT WE CANNOT GIVE  UP THE FIGHT.  I THINK THIS WILL HAVE  DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES, NOT  ONLY FOR THE FUTURE OF MY  COUNTRY, BUT THE FUTURE OF YOUR  COUNTRY, YOUR COUNTRIES. THIS  IS A BATTLE OF CIVILIZATION  AGAINST BARBARISM.  BARBARIANS WILL DO THINGS THAT  CIVILIZED COUNTRIES WILL NEVER  DO.  CIVILIZED COUNTRIES WILL MAKE  EVERY EFFORT TO PREVENT THIS.  I WILL GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE.  I WILL END WITH THAT.  I HAVE TO GO.  I HAVE TO GO MANAGE THIS WAR.  IN 1944, THE ROYAL AIR FORCE  BOMBED THE GESTAPO HEADQUARTERS  IN COPENHAGEN.  IT IS A PERFECTLY LEGITIMTE  TARGET.  THE BRITISH PILOTS MISSED.  INSTEAD OF THE GESTAPO  HEADQUARTERS, THEY HIT A  CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL NEARBY.  I THINK 84 CHILDREN WERE BURNED  TO DEATH.  THAT IS NOT A WAR CRIME.  THAT IS NOT SOMETHING YOU BLAME  BRITAIN FOR DOING.  THAT WAS A LEGITIMATE ACT OF  WAR WITH TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES  THAT ACCOMPANIED SUCH  LEGITIMATE ACTIONS.  THEY DID NOT TELL THE ALLIES.  THEY DID NOT SAY DON'T STAMP  OUT NOT SHE IS AND BECAUSE OF  SUCH TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES.  THEY WENT TO THE END BECAUSE  THEY KNEW THE FUTURE OF OUR  CIVILIZATION WAS AT STAKE.  UNTIL YOU RIGHT NOW.  THE FUTURE OF OUR CIVILIZATION  IS AT STAKE.  WE HAVE TO WIN THIS WAR.  WE WILL DO IT BY MINIMIZING  CIVILIAN CASUALTIES AND MAY WE  SUCCEED.  THANK YOU.  >> YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING  ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN  NETANYAHU TALK ABOUT THE  COUNTRY'S EXPANDED GROUND  OPERATIONS IN GAZA.  HE SAID, ISRAEL DID NOT START  THIS WAR BUT  ISRAEL WILL WIN  THIS WAR.  THE GOAL IS TO ELIMINATE HAMAS  AS AN ORGANIZATION OF ANY KIND,  MILITARY OR GOVERNMENT IN GAZA.  HE ALSO SAID GAZA IS PARTNERING  WITH IRAN TO CREATE AN AXIS OF  EVIL, FOR YOU HAVE HEARD  BEFORE.  NETANYAHU SAID ISRAEL IS DOING  EVERYTHING IT CAN TO  PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS OUT OF  PARMA'S WAY.  HE SAID HAMAS IS DOING ALL THEY  CAN TO KEEP  THEM IN'S WAY,  USING THEM AS HUMAN SHIELDS.  >> HE SAID THEY WOULD NOT AGREE  TO"}, "1mxyKqWs9aI": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mxyKqWs9aI", "video_id": "1mxyKqWs9aI", "description": "Israel and Hamas are set to begin a four-day ceasefire on Friday, when more than a dozen civilian hostages are expected to be released by Hamas.

We   see flares  out there in the   distance. I want to bring  back  into  the conversation.  retired Marines intelligence   officer Howell camphor, how  you have  been  guiding us   through the fact that in   just  a few hours.  is when  that  ceasefire supposed  to   begin,  but as  you just  saw  in that live  picture the  fighting  is going  to   continue  a pretty  heavily.   as  we  get there.  I want to  get into  some of the math   when it comes to  the  hostages  being released   because I know  they're going  to be released. in  groups   They are  the math is  kind of interesting.  the  first day.  when  this was   first announced.   they said 50  will be  released  over   a four-day period it   was supposed to be  20 the   first day ten every day after  that. and then  the Israelis   would release.  three  Palestinian prisoners and the  the Israelis  that  are being  held  or  hostages  by  every  definition. the the  Palestinians  that   they're releasing our  prisoners.  They've gone   through due process.  They've  been  convicted of various.  crimes  and so  they're  releasing those three two one  trade.  well. Hamas as  we've  talked about  before  is   having  a tough time   locating. where all the  hostages  are there there  there.  administrative   Acumen is a little  lacking  in  this  their ability to   figure out  to  basically  communicate.  track.   Everybody is so they've been   tracking  down. not only   within  Hamas but with  a  couple of other groups. most   notably the Islamic Jihad.   to  find  out who they  have.  So  they're going to   exchange  13. hostages  on   the first day and an   exchange. that  they'll be   39. prisoners.  Palestinian  prisoners that are  released   to  the West Bank.  now what   will happen is  Hamas will   turn  them  over  to  the  International Red Cross.   the right?  across  will   then  transport them  to  the  rafah gate, which is  the  gate  that  goes  to  Egypt.   when  they  get to the  rafah  gate. they'll be  met with   Israeli officials.  IDF.   That  will  absolutely   verify  without doubt as  to   who the hostages  are.   that are to be  released.  that  are being released. at   that  point once  they   verified  that  it's  this   person. the family  will  be   formally  notified  that   their that their  loved  one has been. released. East   then they will  be   transported by  helicopter.  to  about 8 or 1 of 8 or ten   hospitals.  throughout.  Israel. were  special.   reception.  has been  set up   to  to  medically evaluate   them  to  give  them  any  treatment.  that's   necessary.  Make  sure  that   they're taking care of  also   a lot of  concern about their  psychological well-being.  considering what  they've  just  gone  through they will  have  a full-time social   worker. that will be there.  constantly  with   them to help  them through   any crisis. while  they're coming  back  when   they're at  the  hospitals. That will  be   when  the family  members can  actually. reunite.  with   their loved ones  there.   although  they're going to   be  under close care  and  scrutiny  for some  time.  This  is  an  incredibly   traumatic.  experience. and  to  say that  the hostages   are by and large  suffering  from  various levels  of   post-traumatic  stress   disorder  would be  a bit of   an  understatement   considering what   they've been  through.   especially  the children, who  are having  such  a tough  time. processing. not only   what's  happened  to  them   not in some cases.  like  the  three-year-old  girl. that   we  hope  will be amongst the  first released. Not only is  she gone through  all of   this. but her parents were   killed. in  the October 7th  attack so she's you know,  she's going to  need  a lot  of  care. to  help  her get  back  to  some  semblance of   normalcy. after this  is  all  done, But all of them are  going to have to  have  a  great deal of care  to  work   on  that. and so  that's   what's going to happen  in   terms of  the prisoner   exchange  interesting.   little  side  note. This  was  all announced and the and the  International Red Cross came   out and said  nobody  had  talked  to  us  about what   we're doing.  and then they  turn  around  say we're ready  to do it, but nobody   actually  coordinated so  I  thought that  was kind of  interesting.  that  the  qataris Hamas.  the Israelis   even  the u.s.  Rahl  making   these plans of  what  the  International Red Cross is   going to  do. but nobody  had  actually  bothered  to   to coordinate with the   already crossed  explain exactly.  what  their  role  would be. even  though   that is what  they're going  to  do  and they  said   they're going they have no   problems  doing that. now the  other side  of this is  at   7 a.m.  Is  when  the  ceasefire the truths are   paused  actually  begins. so   that  will  be   in fact during the  day.  but  the release the exchange  of   hostages  to  prisoners.   doesn't happen  till   4 p.m. Their time in the   afternoon.  So  there's this   long period of  time  where  Hamas and and the IDF will be  assessing whether this is  actually  working as   planned.  prior to  any  exchange  of  hostages   and prisoners.  also  during   that  time. in  southern   Lebanon as I  mentioned  before  they'll be  no   overflights no  drones  or   anything  flying  over. and  Northern  Gaza. from   10:00 to  4:00  in the   afternoon.  They'll be  no   overflights,  but there will   be  drones  flying. for  surveillance  purposes   outside of  those times  although  God's is a  very   narrow  strip of  land. So   the ability to  look  down.  from  surveillance  Airborne   surveillance. platforms into   Gaza. pretty  easy  to do not  to  mention all the  satellite.  capability   and other things  are out  there so  I don't think  that's  going to  be  a huge   hindrance in  terms of  being  able to surveil.  what's   happening.  across   the board.  Although  it   would be  nice  to  have   some  Tactical  groans.  It could get a little bit  closer  to  the ground.  some of those areas those  neighborhoods and stuff.   to look what's going  on   in particular a lie,  or   Street  or  something like   that. However,  it  is  the  arrangement that's  been   met.  the big thing though   is  there's about I think  three hundred trucks  lined  up  today.  to deliver. to   deliver Aid.  and  that's going  to make a huge.  impact  on  the humanitarian   side. as you  know, huge   humanitarian. need. with  all  the displaced Palestinians.  It had to move  from  the  north to  south and then   some  of moving from  parts  of the  to other. to the   South so it's going to bring   in tremendous Aid. There's   been  a Jordanian field  Hospital.  There's a couple of other  field hospitals being set up   in the  south.  There's some   fuel  coming  in to include.   oil for cooking.  so  cooking  fuel. will be coming  in  as   well duh, get those  generators  going.  Hopefully  they'll be  stuff where they   can purify  the water Waters   been  a huge  problem  They're contaminated  water.   and and and start to  address  some of these humanitarian   concerns. in the  agreement  the agreement.  Is  200  trucks  a day are allowed to   go  in  although  I  understand  the first day  there might be  more  than   200.  that  actually  go  in   there.  and and so  there's  a lot going on. even before.   the the hostages   and prisoner  exchange  takes  place in the  afternoon.   Holly.  I do want to bring up  but this  other topic that   you did have  mentioned to me  before  the idea  of  saying   that  to the  operation  against Hamas who will   continue  quote forcefully.  once  this  truce is over  starting  Friday  morning,   and then  you had mentioned  to me that this Saul has   elements. of  psychological  warfare.  if  you can just   explain that  to   our viewers.  here.  absolutely. Netanyahu prime  minister  Netanyahu.  other  members.  of the  Israeli IDF  and as  really  if  you will.  made it,  very  clear that   once  this  truce  period is supposed to go  for  four  days  is  over. then   they  were  are going to  go   back  to  engaging  in  major  Warfare.  operations. now.   there is  this. It   does allow a  continuance  of this pause.  as  long  as   Hamas.  is  releasing  ten hostages  a day.  They   get a day.  of. of   a cessation.  of  fighting   in other words  a ceasefire  or  pause for that  day.  So   they  keep  up  the  ten hostages  a day.   It could  go  on. not just   four days.  It could  go  on.  five six  seven,  I think  eight days  was probably  the  outside that  we  might see.   it's  possible  It could  go   on  further.  There has been   some  very  hopeful.   discussion  that  they  could  get a lot more  hostages   out.  I believe if it goes   over  seven days, they'll  probably  be  some   renegotiation.  in terms  of   what  this  will look like.  and I might guess would be   that  Israel  might demand.  more  hostages  get released   per day in order  to   maintain  the pause and  military operations.  one  thing they  said  today was  that they said  the Israeli  defense minister  said  that   basically he  sees  us  this   fighting  going on  for  a couple  of  months. and  that's  where you kind of get  into psychological  warfare.   Hamas has to  figure  out do   they  want  to  immediately  go  back  into  what would   be a  couple  of months more   fighting? and the reality is   that  was so  tough I mean   it  was weeks and weeks  and weeks.  of  very   intense.  negotiations  some   of  the negotiations. that   were  going on. Just  prior  to  the announcement  of   this  deal. the the  Negotiator some cells  were lucky  to get   two or three  hours of  sleep  per night.  They  were   working till  2:00  in the   morning.  and then  they   were  back doing  stuff at   4:00 a.m. So  they  would lie  down  for empty. They closed   her eyes for  two hours.  get  up  and they were  back working again. So   Gives you an idea.   of the intensity  of   what was  going on in Qatar.   in  order to  arrange this.  but everyone  has made  it   pretty  clear that  once   this  one's done  It's  less   likely  they'll ever  see  something like  this.  The other thing is  once  you  see a pause or  cease fire   it  is  difficult to  not not  operationally so  much. but  politically it's  difficult  to  go  back  and start.   start the war fighting   again.  and and that's  what   they  have  to  look  at  is   that  you know  Hamas is   going to  have to figure   that  out as  well   Israel is going to  have to  figure  that out. what it  look like to start  the war  fighting  again.  My  guess  is  that  when  it  does   turn  back  on. if  it  does   unless  something truly.   amazing does  happen  on  the  Diplomatic  front.  that  it   would be  extremely.   intense.  and that  Israel   want to prosecute.  as  much   territory.  or  go after   basically uncovers  much   territory and  and prosecutors meet. argit's  as  they  possibly  could  in the short  amount  of time  frame.  to  eliminate Hamas  and pij  Palestinian Islamic Jihad.   from  their positions because  they  don't want  this  thing  to go on  any longer  It has   to  all things  being said   they  would very much like   to  see this  be   a much shorter  Act of War.  and go into what   are essentially sometimes  called  mopping up   operations. afterwards  and  then  deal  more   forthrightly  with  the  humanitarian. concerns  of   the displaced.  civilian   help a retired  Marines  intelligence  officer always   a pleasure  to have you here   at  live  now from  Fox,  of   course, This  is  a  developing  story.  in  the  next  few hours is  when   that ceasefire  is  going to   commence. officially. and if   you are was after that   is when we should start  seeing  those hostages  being  exchanged between Israel  and  Hamas.  We  are going to   welcome you back  as  we   continue  to  cover.  all of   these.  developments  here.  but for the time  being I do   appreciate  you coming  on   here  breaking  this  down   ahead of  going to be be a   big event in  the middle  of   this  war.  and sir,  "}, "YIjsoHrHm6A": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A", "video_id": "YIjsoHrHm6A", "description": "FOX News' Alex Hogan breaks down reports that Hamas is delaying the second release of hostages over claims Israel is not abiding by cease-fire conditions. #foxnews Subscribe to Fox News! https://bit.ly/2vBUvAS Watch more Fox News Video: http://video.foxnews.com Watch Fox News Channel Live: http://www.foxnewsgo.com/ FOX News Channel (FNC) is a ...", "duration": "5:17", "published_date": "2023-11-25", "publisher": "YouTube", "statistics": {"viewCount": 87561}, "title": "Hamas claims Israel not abiding by cease-fire terms", "uploader": "Fox News", "transcript": "GOING AFTER US. DAVID: AVIV EZRA, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.   ALEX HOGAN JOINS US LIVE FROM  JERUSALEM.   I ASSUME YOU'VE HEARD THIS  REUTERS REPORT AND I'M  WONDERING IF WE HAVE BEEN ABLE  TO CONFIRM IT INDEPENDENTLY AT  ALL? >> HI, DAVID, YES, THERE'S A  STATEMENT FROM HAMAS OFFICIALS  SAYING THEY'RE DELAYING THE  START OF THE RELEASE OF THESE  HOSTAGES CITING, THEY CLAIM  THAT ISRAEL IS NOT ABIDING BY  THE CONDITIONS OF THE  CEASE-FIRE.   WHAT THEY MEAN BY THAT, THEY'RE ARGUING THAT THERE ARE SIMPLY  NOT ENOUGH AID THAT'S FLOWING  INTO GAZA TO GIVE RELIEF TO  MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE  DISPLACED.   WE KNOW WITHIN SOUTHERN GAZA  THERE'S A FLOW THROUGHOUT GAZA. THREE QUARTERS OF MORE THAN TWO MILLION POPULATION ARE OUT OF  THEIR HOMES BECAUSE OF THE  FIGHTING.   HAMAS HAS NOT GIVEN CLARITY AS  TO SPECIFICALLY HOW LONG THE  DELAY COULD TAKE PLACE, BUT  THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE CITING  RIGHT NOW, THERE NEEDS TO BE  MORE HUMANITARIAN AID SENT IN  IN ORDER FOR THE THE RELEASE OF THE HOSTAGES.   WE HAD HEARD EARLIER THIS HOUR  FROM OFFICIALS IN EGYPT THEY  HAVE STARTED TO SEE HAMAS BRING THE HOSTAGES, START TO TRANSFER THEM TO THE RED CROSS.   OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S ALL BEEN  HALTED AT THIS POINT AS WE WILL WAIT TO SEE HOW ALL OF THIS  UNFOLDS.   THIS HAS BEEN THE MAIN REASON  WHY ISRAEL HAS NOT BEEN  RELEASING THE SPECIFIC NAMES ON THE LISTS, WHICH HOSTAGES HAVE  BEEN RELEASED OUT OF CONCERNS  THAT SOMETHING COULD HAPPEN  JUST LIKE THIS, THERE COULD BE  EITHER A PAUSE, AN END TO THE  CEASE-FIRE, WHICH THANKFULLY WE HAVE NOT SEEN THAT, BUT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONCERN, A LOT OF ANXIETY HERE ON THE GROUND THAT ALL OF THIS COULD FLIP ON A  SWITCH AND WE COULD STOP TO SEE THE HOSTAGE RELEASE TAKING  PLACE, BUT IT'S WORTH NOTING,  THERE'S STILL A MAJOR EFFORT ON BOTH SIDES, TO SEE ALL OF THIS  UNFOLD AS THE DEAL HAD BEEN  BROKERED THAT THERE SHOULD BE  MORE HUMANITARIAN AID GOING TO  GAZA THAT ISRAEL WOULD RELEASE  150 PALESTINIANS IN EXCHANGE  FOR 50 HOSTAGES, THOSE GOALS  ARE VERY MUCH AT THE FOREFRONT  OF THE MIND OF BOTH PARTIES.   WE'LL CONTINUE TO WATCH THIS  AND WE'RE GETTING MORE IMAGES  COMING OUT NOW OF AT LEAST THE  13 ISRAELI FAMILY MEMBERS AND  FAMILIES WHO ARE TOGETHER FOR  THE VERY FIRST DAY.   ONE LITTLE BOY, A 9-YEAR-OLD,  HE'S ACTUALLY NOT ONLY HAVING A PARTY AT THE HOSPITAL WITH HIS  FRIENDS, BUT HE'S ALSO SEEING  THE IMAGES AND THE PHOTOS HIS  PARENTS SHOWING HIM ALL THE  MESSAGES HE RECEIVED WHILE IN  CAPTIVITY.   SO THERE'S A LOT OF UNFOLDING  AT THE SAME TIME.   THESE ARE THE IMAGES OF ALL OF  THE 13 HOSTAGES WHO HAVE BEEN  RELEASED IN THE LAST 24 HOURS.  SO 13 OTHER HOSTAGES  POTENTIALLY, 14, WERE EXPECTED  TO BE ON THE WAY BACK TO ISRAEL RIGHT NOW AND WHAT WOULD HAVE  TAKEN PLACE, THEY WOULD HAVE  BEEN HANDED OVER TO RED CROSS,  MADE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE  RAFAH CROSSING AND MAKE IT TO  ISRAEL SOIL AND GO THROUGH  EXAMINATIONS AND REUNITED WITH  FAMILIES.   A LOT OF HOPE ON THE GROUND  THAT THIS WILL TAKE PLACE.   AND WE'LL WAIT AND SEE HOW  ISRAEL RESPONDS TO THIS.   WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL  STATEMENT FROM ISRAELI  OFFICIALS JUST YET WHETHER  THEY'LL SEND IN MORE  HUMANITARIAN AID.   IF THE AID THAT'S BEEN SENT IN  SO FAR IS WHAT SHOULD SUFFICE.  WE'LL CONTINUE TO MONITOR ON  THE GROUND. DAVID: VERY, VERY QUICKLY,  ALEX, ARE YOU HEARING FROM  ISRAELIS THAT THE SUGGESTION  THAT THIS COULD ON THE PART OF  HAMAS SOMEBODY SUBTERFUGE, THE  ISSUES THAT THEY'RE HAVING WITH THE NEXT GROUP OF RELEASED, A  SUBTERFUGE TO SIMPLY DELAY  MILITARY OPERATIONS AGAINST  THEM IN GAZA BY THE ISRAELIS? >> WELL, I THINK, AND ALSO YOU  MENTIONED THIS WITH YOUR LAST  GUEST, ASKING IS HAMAS USING  THIS TO ITS ADVANTAGE TO TRY TO REASSESS ITS FORCES, BUILD BACK ITS STRENGTH.   I THINK ONE THING WORTH NOTING, IT'S IMPORTANT TO STRESS JUST  BEFORE THE CEASE-FIRE, WE DID  SEE BOTH SIDES TYPICALLY BEFORE A CEASE-FIRE WILL BUILD UP  THEIR MILITARY OPERATIONS AND  ISRAEL SAID IT WANTED TO MAKE  SURE IT WAS KNOWN IT WAS ABLE  TO DESTROY AS MANY AS 400  TUNNELS SO REALLY TAKING OUT A  LOT OF HAMAS INFRASTRUCTURE TO  MAKE SURE THAT DURING THIS  CEASE-FIRE, HAMAS WASN'T ABLE  TO REASSESS, REMOVE ITS FORCES  AND REESTABLISH ITSELF.   ONE CONCERN WE'VE HEARD ON THE  GROUND, INTERESTING TO THINK  OF, WITH THE UNFOLDING OF THE  WHOLE SCENARIO THAT WE SAW  YESTERDAY WITH THE RELEASE OF  THESE HOSTAGES GIVEN BACK TO  ISRAEL, THAT WAS ALL ORGANIZED  AND DELIVERED, YOU KNOW, QUITE  WELL.   WE SAW EVERYTHING GO ACCORDING  TO PLAN YESTERDAY.   WHILE THAT'S A BIG WIN HERE FOR ISRAEL, IT WAS ALSO SEEN AS AN  OBVIOUS SIGN THAT HAMAS IS  QUITE ORGANIZED.   WHICH IS THE LAST THING THAT  ISRAELI FORCES WOULD WANT TO  SEE AND THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT  WOULD WANT TO SEE AFTER ALMOST  SEVEN WEEKS OF THE WAR TRYING  TO DISMANTLE HAMAS.   RIGHT NOW WE'RE SEEING THE  POTENTIAL DELAY.   IT WORTH NOTING THE HOSTAGES  WERE NOT RELEASED EXACTLY AT 4  P.M. LOCAL.   THERE WAS A COUPLE OF HOURS  THAT IT WAS DELAYED AND THE  GOAL IS FOR THAT TO RESUME A"}, "99PVAkptFzg": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99PVAkptFzg", "video_id": "99PVAkptFzg", "description": "In an exclusive interview with Israeli prime minister, David Muir presses on calls for humanitarian pauses and whether Netanyahu bears responsibility for the intelligence failures prior to the attack.

News exclusive interview with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as new images from Gaza Today Show a barrage of explosions lighting up the night sky the Israel Defense Force is announcing it's deepening operations in Gaza City calling the fighting quote Close Quarters Urban Warfare the Hamas run Health Ministry in Gaza is saying as many as 10,000 civilians have been killed since the War Began exactly one month ago ABC's David Mir spoke with Netanyahu earlier today in the prime min Minister's first one-onone interview since the war broke out Mr Prime Minister thank you for joining us here I know you spoke with President Biden just a short time ago President Biden has repeatedly said that Israel has every right to defend itself has an obligation to defend its people we also know what the administration is now saying calling for a humanitarian pause to help get Aid into Gaza and to help minimize the deaths of Palestinian civilians will there be a pause first of all let me say that I deeply appreciate as do the entire people of Israel President Biden's and the American government the American people's support for Israel uh with a great moral Clarity I I think there's a uh the question of a a ceasefire the president himself has said that a ceasefire would be a surrender to Hamas it would be a victory for Hamas and you would no more have it than you would have a ceasefire after the Al Qaeda bombings of the World Trade Center I know the Biden Administration has also said now is not the time for a ceasefire what they're proposing is a humanitarian pause there will be no pause well there will be no uh ceasefire General ceasefire in Gaza without the release of our hostages as far as tactical little pauses an hour here an hour there we've had them before I suppose uh we'll check the circumstances in order to enable uh Goods humanitarian Goods to come in or our hostages uh individual hostages to leave but I don't think there's going to be a general ceas far uh it's not that I don't think I think it will hamper the war effort it'll hamper our effort to get our hostages out because the only thing that works on these criminals in Kamas is the military pressure that we're exerting if Hamas agrees to release the hostages then there would be a pause well there'd be a ceasefire for that purpose uh and we're waiting for that to happen it hasn't happened so far do you know where the hostages are do you know where the Americans are we have some intelligence I'm not sure it's wise to uh share it here with come I know you said you're doing everything you can to minimize civilian casualties obviously the world saw the horror in Israel the 14400 brutally killed uh in that terror attack we were on the ground for several days as you know but the world has now also seen the toll in Gaza the health Ministry run by Hamas now says 10,000 Palestinian civilians have been killed uh 4,000 of them children I'm not asking about Hamas here I'm asking about the 10,000 of civilians killed are you concerned about the number of civilians that we've seen lost caught in the middle of this conflict I think every civilian loss is a tragedy every civilian life lost is a tragedy uh we're fighting an enemy that is uh particularly brutal they're using their civilians as human Shields and while we're asking the Palestinian civilian population to leave the war zone they're preventing them at gunpoint they're using them as human Shields I know you have told Palestinian civilians to move to the South we know that there have been strikes uh in the South as well uh we should just point that out when you talk about the tactics used by Hamas the world is aware of those tactics are you taking that into account because when you start to see numbers that are difficult to wrap your head around 10,000 Palestinian civilians is there a more targeted approach in going after Hamas being explored here to try to minimize the number of Palestinian civilians uh who are not Hamas who are not militants who've lost their lives here uh the answer is yes first of all I wouldn't take those numbers at face value I think we have to check them and there are quite a few several thousand uh Palestinian combatants there that is Hamas terrorist that we've that are Incorporated in those numbers it's a very tough enemy but we can't let them have immunity if we let them have immunity David then barbar barbarians win you have refused any temporary pause that doesn't include the return of hostages you mentioned that right here with me again today I I'm curious what you would say to the families of those hostages who believe that this mounting civilian death toll in Gaza now at 10,000 is putting their own loved ones uh these hostages at greater risk well we're taking that into consideration believe me there's no one who wants to get our hostages back more than us uh I think that uh it's it's important to understand that uh there is no way to defeat terrorists and embedded in a civilian population without going as in as targeted a way as you can against a terrorist but there will be unfortunately these civilian casualties we'll do again and again I say it we'll do everything in our power to reduce that you spoke with President Biden just before you came on the year here to talk with me does he agree with you on this no pause unless hostages or is this a disagreement with President Biden we agree on many things I've known uh President Biden I've known Joe Biden for 40 years he's a great great supporter of Israel and he's a great friend it's trying times for uh both of us and for the people of Israel and our friends we understand that but we have to stand together I think we're we stand together but there is daylight here on this notion of a humanitarian pause you don't agree with the Biden Administration on that we agree that we have to provide humanitarian assistance we're doing it with uh and coordinating it with our American friends and with President Biden we'll do whatever we can we don't want to give Hamas the opportunity to endanger our soldiers we saw that until we started the ground action there was no pressure on them to release hostages what we see is the minute we started the ground action there is pressure I know Israel prided itself on its intelligence capabilities we now know the Hamas attack had been planned for months we saw the training videos of course we saw the thousands of amas terrorists swarming into Israel how did your government miss this it's a very good question because the first uh task of government is to protect the people and clearly we didn't live up to that uh we had a big big setback as prime minister do you personally bear any responsibility here I've said that there are going to be very tough questions the the that are going to be asked and I'm going to be uh the among the first to answer them uh we're not going to inade that the responsibility of a government is to protect the people and clearly that responsibility wasn't met but you know what I'm asking here because so many Israeli officials including the defense minister the military intelligence Chief the military Chief of Staff they ' all taken uh some responsibility for Israel being caught off guard they didn't say we have to wait for an investigation here do you believe that you should take any responsibility of course that's not a question it's going to be resolved after the war uh I think there'll be time to allocate that we're all sitting here the responsibility of government the responsibility of ne's prime minister is to protect the people of Israel we could not achieve that clearly uh we didn't achieve that but we have to decide exactly what we need to do L next time right now we have one thing to do and that is to win the war and I'm not dealing with my personal fate I'm dealing with the fate of the country President Biden has said that it would be a mistake for Israel to occupy Gaza who should govern Gaza when this is over those who don't want to uh continue the way of Kamas it certainly is not I think Israel will for an indefinite period will have the overall uh security responsibility because we've seen what happened when we don't have it when we don't have that security responsibility what we have is the eruption of Hamas Terror on a scale that we couldn't imagine do you have a warning to Iran to isbah I think they've uh understood that if they enter the war in a significant way the response will be very very powerful and I hope they don't make that mistake Mr Prime Minister thank you for taking the time for us I appreciate it thank you David our David M we will continue to cover the developments in the Israel Hamas War hi everyone George

Aid into  the  region  want to talk  more   about these developments  and  really  the latest  as  the  war does. continue  Michael  Barnett is  a university   professor of  fares and  political science at  the  George Washington University   and joins us  now live  to   discuss this. Thank you so   much  for taking  the time   to be here  with us  this morning. So  my  first  question  for you is  about  this  possible. hostage  ceasefire deal. We've kind of  seen  things. developing   over the  past. I would say  week or so  as  president  Biden had said  that  it  was  in  its final stages  and  getting close.  Netanyahu  said  over the  weekend that   No Deal had been reached. is   it  possible  that  we could   actually  possible  these  hostages  were released and  that ceasefire  so  to  speak  for a five-day  period  is   that  looking like  it  is   likely? well, we  still have   to  figure  out why it  is   that. there are these rumors   of  a deal  but yet  prime minister  Netanyahu as   insisted  that  no deal is   in  the works.  but it  does   seem  like  something will   be  announced today.  the  rumors  are anywhere  from   45  to  55. hostages  mainly   the children  and women.  and  in exchange They'll be   anywhere  from a Ford.  25   day ceasefire the Israelis   have  not wanted  to  have   any kind  of  ceasefire  because they're worried that   Hamas will  use that   opportunity to  regroup.  and  so  they  don't want  to   give  them  that  kind  of   respite but nevertheless. the  desire  of  bringing  out the  hostages, which is  always   been  one of  not in  Yahoo's  War aims. seems as  if   it would be impossible. over   him to turn down  a deal.  How would that  change  the  war overall if  this  did  happen? is  this  going to   have  a big impact? if you   have  this  five  day so  to   speak and I keep  saying. so   to  speak because it's  not  really  by  definition. a  ceasefire.  It's  more  a  humanitarian  pause How would  all of  this  change the  war  overall?  Well, I don't think  it would  change. the overall  trajectory  by  much. what   you would see is. hopefully a  rush. Bye.  the humanitarian   teams to  bring in   Aid and relief. medical  supplies  water.  and another  essential Goods into  Gaza.  That  would hopefully provide  some  modicum of  assistance   for the two point 1 million  gazans. but nevertheless  I  don't expect that.  at   Israeli government  will put   on  any kind  of  pause.   permanent pause in terms  of   its own.  War aims  and  military  assaults. So  I  I really don't think  that   it  will  have  that  much   of a  long-term impact   it will be  just  as   advertised. the pause.  and  let's talk  about the  significance of the  houthi saying that   they took.  hostage a  cargo ship  that  was  believed to be  linked   to Israel now Israel says  that it was not their ship   but does it show  that  the  war is  kind of?  extending  into  let's say a larger   Regional  conflict  now.   well  the houthis.  Israel   just a few  weeks ago.   booties are connected to   Iran in Iran is obviously got  technicals throughout the  region  including  nominally to  kamaz, but   also  to  his Bella and so   Iran's  game  has been  to   avoid any kind  of  direct.  confrontation with  Israel   or  the US. but nevertheless.  use its instruments  instruments as a way of  distracting Israel  and the  u.s.  as  a way of   demonstrating.  that  it   continues to  you know  play   havoc in the  region. and and  can cause trouble at  its  will  We  saw that   surveillance  video that  was  released  by  the IDF.  It's   from  October 7th when  Hamas  did attack. Israel  and it   shows what  they  say.  is.  Hostages  being taken through  shifa.  Hospital  Does  that   prove Is that enough   evidence  to  prove that?  Hamas is  actually  operating  out of  gaza's  largest  hospital. well  here  I want   to  be  careful.  I mean   there's I don't think there's  much  question  that. Hamas  is  me. Come on.   us very much  controls  much   of  the hospital. in  many   respects  and it  does  use  the basement  and other  corridors as  a way of  of   ferreting troops  supplies   and so  forth.  I mean,  I think that  part  has been   accepted  by  most.  intelligence  analyst.  but  whether or  not that   provides  justification for  Israel's  attacks is  another  matter. because in  all these  discussions we  have  to   remember  that  while in fact  the hospital  might have  had  its immunity  compromised by   Hamas.  activities. that   doesn't necessarily mean   that  it's  Rail is released   from  any.  of  its  obligations.  under the laws   of  war.  so  I think Israel   wants to  be  able  to   demonstrate that  in  fact.  the hostages. have  molk have  been  moved through shape of   but it  doesn't necessarily.   mean  that  Israel. can do   what  a 1 or  has done. or   gives a justification for  what  it has  done. What   do you  make of?  netanyahu's  comments  that? Israel  has  been  quote not.  successful   in  preventing. civilian.  casualties. He  did say that   over the  weekend and one of   his lengthier speeches. What   do you  make  of  those  comments  as  there are calls  for a ceasefire?  with  those  civilian? casualties? Well   I think 19  Yahoo's very   careful.  He's a  very  sly.   politician  and he's  very   careful in his  language  and  on  the one hand  you can say  that  he's  that's  not been   successful. which  suggests that they've been   trying. on  the other hand.  you could read  this  as  an   acknowledgement.  that  the  International Community is   horrified.  by  the civilian   death toll  and  what he's trying to  but in fact there's  relatively  little  evidence.  that  Israel  has really   attempted to  comply   with the  laws  of  war and  instead has been  quite  excessive and at this moment.  most  sort of objective  International legal.   Scholars. based on  the  evidence  they  have  is   that  you know, Israel. as   probably  engaged in  various  kinds of  war crimes. So   this  is  a brief way for not  in Yahoo  to  say we're  trying. as  a public   relations.  plead to  the  International Community,  but  I don't think anybody's  buying. what  is  the  overall?  impression  and  feeling toward? Netanyahu  there in  Israel? Because I  know  prior to  the war  we were covering. every  weekend a protest.   They are within Israel  with.  hundreds  upon  hundreds of  people  that  were  there  to protest  Netanyahu,   obviously at  this  point.   those protests   and demonstrations. have   stopped as  the war is   ongoing.  but what  is  the  overall impression of  Netanyahu?  toward Netanyahu   there in  Israel? Because  I know prior to the war. We  were covering every weekend a  protest there within Israel  with hundreds upon hundreds of people that were there to  protest Netanyahu obviously at this point those protests and  demonstrations have stopped as the war is ongoing. But what   is the overall impression of   Netanyahu there in Israel  among the civilians there?   well  he still  has a base.  that  will  support him  regardless  of. the  accusation. and his own  court trial.  for corruption.  but I think you know  if you   were  to  try to  rank  in   Israel  who?  who's the most   hated between Hamas and  knots in Yahoo, and certainly  be  Hamas.  but not in Yahoo   Would rank  up  there as   well. Not in Yahoo  is   in many ways. bailiff I'd not  only  for what  he's  done   in terms  of. of  what  he   didn't do in terms  of   protecting. Israel  from   Comas.  He's  vilified  by   the way.  he  has tried to   use the war to  maintain  his  own.  political survival. his  right-wing Coalition  is   certainly you know,  loved by those  in  the right  way,  but very  much   despised  by  many  of  those  people  that  we  were   seeing  come  out.   every week, to  protest  against his attempted.   judicial  push. So  the  one of  the big questions is   that  you know, what's   going to  happen  when  the  war is over whatever  that   looks like. and most people  expect  that. there will  be   a lot of  different parts of   Israeli society That  will   want to see him go. of  this   is the last of  19 Yahoo.  That's  anybody's guess.   he's  shown to  have   you know. several lives.  and  he's  been  able  to  sort   of  keep  coming  back  even   when  everybody said  he  was  finished. So, who knows he   may still be  prime minister   for some  time. I doubt it. I  think there's there will be a  desperate desire  to  see the  end of  not to  whose reign  mmmmm.  I want to get your   opinion and your  thoughts on  this  because this  is  a  question  that  I've  asked  several different experts  who have  been  here  on  the  show. We  know  that  there  have  been  calls for  a ceasefire.  from  allies   of  Israel. We  know   within the  last  week  or so  We  had the French   President say that  there  needs President be  a  ceasefire.  does  any of   this? any of  it  carry any  sort of weight  with   Netanyahu as  he  works with   this  war and decides  what happens  next  does  it   all carry?  any sort of  weight  with  him?  Most   reasonable  assessment   say no. and I don't think  it's  we  have  to  recognize  this  not just  not in   Yahoo,  but I think overall.   much  of  Israeli Society  does not  want  to  see a  ceasefire.  What  would  they're still traumatized by   and will be 4 decades to come  is  October 7th.  and  for them. the only  response   to  October 7th is  the  complete annihilation.  of   Hamas.  and if that also   means that  a lot of   Gaza civilians  were also  going to  die in  the effort   then. So be it. and there's  been  you know  if  there are  pressures to  begin.  to   look  at  a ceasefire will   become  from  probably   two sources.  one.  one is   going to  be  the economy.   you have. about a third of  a  million.  Israeli soldiers.  mobilized.  who are then   taken out of  the work.  out of the  workplace.  and  that's  having  a dramatic.  impact. on  the  Israeli economy,  so  it's   we'll have to see how long   they  can.  economically   sustain that  and the other  is  the demand  to  bring  home  the hostages. and so   that's  that  has been   a major worng.  so  I can  imagine.  that  if  let's say  eventually  most  or if not  all the hostages  come  home.  that  could probably  lead   to  a greater ceasefire, but   until the hostages  are back.  and in  until Hamas is   obliterated.  I think we're  in  for a very. long  war and  I don't see any kind  of   pressure  from  the outside.   shaping Israel's. timetable  because ultimately  from the   Israeli perspective.  This   is  about their existential  security. And so  they  can  certainly if  you will   resist  International  pressure  because the  alternative for them  is  the  end of  Israel  my  last   question  for you here. has  the u.s.  Involvement.   changed over the  past   several weeks because we   are now in  week  7 of  this   war between Israel and   Hamas.  has the u.s.   Involvement.  President  Biden's Administration  any  of  it  changed over   the last  several weeks.   Yeah, there's been  an   interesting shift in   rhetoric  and in  some   policy. so  when  when   October 7th happened  Biden  did something that  you know   Israelis  continue. to  be   impressed by  which is  that   he  went  to  Israel  and  showed  his support.  grieve   with  them. and over  the  next  several weeks.  was  unwavering  in his   his support for Israel  not  just  in terms  of  its  rhetoric, but also  into   in terms  of  arms  supplies.  as  the war has continued  though  and as  the death  toll  has escalated.  in   Gaza. he's  backed off  of   it. He's  been  saying  that   putting more  pressure  on.  Israel. to  demonstrate more.  concerned for the civilians  and to  honor the laws  of   war.  There's been  clamor.  clamor. in  Congress  to   begin to  look  at   arms sales to Israel. in  a  new light.  especially  since  there are human rights.  principles  that  are often  attached  to these  arms   sales.  so  that  when   weapon  American   weapon systems are  used   they're not used in violation  of  the laws of war.  so   he's  cognizant of this.  and  cognizant of  the fact that  he  may not want to time   self to now Because who knows  We're not in  Yahoo's  going to go.  and so  he   needs to  demonstrate some.  Independents  because there's  no  reason why  I think  President Biden shouldn't  necessarily want  to   tie himself to the  Mast  of   the Prime Minister. All  right,  Michael Barnett.   Thank you so  much  for  taking  the time  to  join   us  in  provide that   perspective helping Brad   break down a  story that I   always  say has new  developments. pretty  much   on  an  hourly  basis.  Is   there anything  else  you  want to add here  before?  I let you go. no, really, I  but I think your   point earlier about whether  there's any way to  bring  pressure  on  Israel  Not  not.  necessarily to stop the  war because I do  think  that's  not realistic.  but  rather  to  begin.  to   generally comply  with  the  laws  of  war so  that  you  know. that  the suffering  unnecessary suffering and  death is  taking  place in   guys that can stop.

The tiny Emirate has led mediation efforts in Afghanistan, Iran and Ukraine in recent years. From helping the U.S. evacuate 58,000 people after the Taliban takeover in 2021 to brokering a prisoner swap deal between the U.S. and Iran ...", "duration": "5:14", "published_date": "2023-11-10", "publisher": "YouTube", "statistics": {"viewCount": 280165}, "title": "How Qatar Became the World's Lead Hostage Negotiator | WSJ", "uploader": "The Wall Street Journal", "transcript": "- As the war rages over here in Gaza, mediation efforts are being led by Qatar, a tiny peninsula on the\nPersian Gulf 1,100 miles away. The country has used its\nclose ties with both Hamas and the West to negotiate the\nrelease of hostages from Gaza and get others out through the\nborder crossing with Egypt. It's just the latest example of Qatar's important\nrole on the world stage, from helping the US evacuate thousands of people from Afghanistan to\nbrokering a prisoner swap deal between the US and Iran. Here's how Qatar became\nsuch an important player in global diplomacy. Qatar's location and economic clout make it strategically important to a lot of different countries. It shares its only land\nborder with Saudi Arabia, a major power in the Middle East, and it shares the world's\nlargest natural gas field right here with Iran, Saudi's\nbiggest regional rival. Exports of liquified natural\ngas have made Qatar one of the wealthiest countries in the world, boosting its influence\nin this volatile region. This has made Qatar a critical\nenergy partner for a lot of countries, especially those in Europe because the continent has\nbeen reducing its reliance on Russian oil and gas. Qatar is also important\nto the United States, and right here is the\nbiggest US military base in the Middle East. It's been a launching pad for\noperations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. Last year, the US made\nQatar a major non-NATO ally. Qatar has also made itself\ninfluential in the broader region through Al Jazeera, the largest news media\nnetwork in the Middle East, but it has been criticized\nin both the Arab world and the West for its sometimes\ncontroversial coverage of uprisings, wars and other conflicts. For example, the network\nbroadcast video messages from Osama bin Laden after 9/11. Nevertheless, Qatar prides\nitself on being a meeting place for diverse viewpoints,\nwhich was on full display when the country hosted\nthe World Cup last year, and its ambassador to the US\nrecently wrote an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, claiming that \"Qatar is the\nMid-East's honest broker.\" In the 1980s and '90s the country's leaders developed\nrelationships with Iran, as well as regional groups like Hamas in the Palestinian territories and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, groups that are considered\nterrorist organizations in some parts of the world. It also fostered ties\nwith the Afghan Taliban. In 2013, the Taliban opened\na political office in Qatar with support from the US\nand Afghan governments. Years of negotiations in\nDoha led to a deal in 2020 for US troops to withdraw\nfrom Afghanistan, ending America's longest war. (people clapping) But the agreement didn't\nbring peace to the country. The Taliban never reached\na power sharing agreement with the Afghan government, and it seized control of Kabul in 2021. Qatar helped to evacuate US\ncitizens in the aftermath, and it is now Washington's\ndiplomatic representative in the country. Hamas also opened a political\noffice in Qatar in 2012 after a request by the\nObama administration to establish indirect\nlines of communication, and Qatar has provided financial aid to Palestinians in Gaza,\nwhich is run by Hamas. That has led to accusations\nof funding terrorism, which Qatar denies. Qatar's complex web of relationships has caused friction with its neighbors. In 2017, it was blockaded\nby Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt. They accused Doha of meddling\nin their domestic affairs, supporting extremist groups, and being too close to\nregional rival Iran. The four countries\nissued a list of demands, including shutting down Al Jazeera and reducing ties with Tehran. Even though Qatar didn't make concessions, the blockade ended in January of 2021, and the terms of the deal\nhaven't been made public. Although the country's\nreestablished relations, some analysts say that the root causes of that diplomatic crisis\nhaven't been resolved. Today, Qatar's diplomatic relationships are in the spotlight once again with the country negotiating the release of hostages taken from\nIsrael into Gaza by Hamas. (bomb exploding) But Qatar said that without a\npause in the fighting in Gaza, its mediators won't be\nable to do their work. - It's a very, very difficult negotiation that we've been dealing with. I always say that one of\nthe most difficult mediation is difficult between two parties that have zero confidence in each other. - Israeli officials have said that Qatar's efforts are\ncrucial at this time, but so far, only a few\nhostages have been released. And when the crisis is over, many of Qatar's partners want it to expel Hamas leaders from the country, that includes more than\n100 members of Congress who signed a letter to President Biden. Qatar said that the political office of Hamas will remain open as long as it can be used toward peace. Some diplomats worry\nthat those Hamas leaders could move somewhere\nmore hostile to the West, like Iran or Syria. That could make any\ncommunication between Hamas, Israel and the West even more complicated in situations like the one that is currently unfolding\nin the Middle East.

blatant line ABC News could not independently verify those claims but the White House says us intelligence supports Israel's assertions and tonight we press the Israeli military AK-47s are not

for nearly 50 days beginning this morning under a deal reached by extensive us diplomacy including numerous calls I've made from the Oval Office to leaders across the region fighting in Gua will halt for four days this deal also is structured to allow a pause to continue for more than 50 hostages to be released that's our goal this morning I've been engaged with my team as we began the first difficult days of implementing this deal it's only a start but so far it's gone well early this morning 13 Israeli hostages were released including an edly woman a grandmother and mothers with their young children some under the age of 6 years old separately several Thai Nationals and Filipino Nationals were also kidnapped by Hamas on on the 7th they were released as well all of these hostages have been through a terrible ordeal and this is the beginning of a long journey of healing for them the teddy bears waiting to greet those children at the hospital are a stark reminder of the trauma these children have been through and at such a very young age Jill and I Jill's with me are keeping them all in our prayers today today today has been a product of a lot of hard work and weeks of personal engagement from the moment Hamas kidnapped these people I along with my team have worked around the clock to secure their release we saw the first results of this effort with the release of two American hostages in late October followed by the release of two Israeli hostages I've consistently pressed for a pause in the fighting for two reasons to accelerate and expand humanitarian assistance going into Gaza and two to facilitate the release of hostages and over the past several weeks I've spoken repeatedly with the Amir of cutter the president CCE of Egypt and prime minister n nany of Israel to help secure this steal to nail it down and I want to thank all three leaders for their personal partnership to get this done I spoke with the Emir and president LCC and the Prime Minister Netanyahu again on Wednesday to confirm the elements of the engagement as I said today's release are the start of a process we expect more hostages to be released tomorrow and more the day after and more the day after that over the next few days we expect that dozens of hostages will be returned to their families we also remember all those who are still being held and renew our commitment to work for their release as well two American women and one four-year-old child Abigail who remains among those missing we also will not stop until we get these hostages brought home and an answer to their whereabouts I remain in personal contact with the leaders of C Egypt and Israel to make sure this stays on track and every aspect of the deal is implemented you know uh this extended pause in the fighting brings a critical opportunity to deliver much needed food medicine water and fuel to the civilians in Gaza and we are not wasting one single minute since my trip to Israel last month I've been focused on accelerating the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Gaza in coordination with the United Nations and the Red Cross I just spoke in my special Envoy for the Middle East humanitarian issues David saterfield for an update and I've asked him to monitor our progress hour by hour and keep me personally informed from the beginning we put in place mechanisms to prevent Hamas from diverting these supplies and we're continuing that effort to make sure Aid gets to the people who need it more than 200 trucks arrived at the Crossing Point in Egypt into Gaza today these these trucks carry food and medicine as well as fuel fuel and cooking gas the fuel will be used not only to power the trucks delivering this life-saving supplies but for desalinization for water wells for hospitals and for bakeries and hundreds more trucks are getting in position as well ready to enter Gaza over the coming days to support the innocent Palestinians who are suffering greatly because of this war that Hamas has Unleashed Hamas doesn't give damn about them we also look to the Future as we look to the future we have to end this cycle of violence in the Middle East we need to renew our resolve to pursue this two-state solution where Israelis and Palestinians can one day live side by side in a two-state solution with equal measure of freedom and dignity two states for two peoples and it's more important now than ever hamash Unleashed this terrorist attack because they fear nothing more than Israelis and Palestinians living side by side in peace you know to continue down the path of Terror and violence and killing war is to give Hamas what they seek and we can't do that so today let's continue to be thankful for all the families who are now and those who will soon be brought together again I want to one once again thank the Amir of cutter president CC of Egypt and prime minister Nano for their partnership to make what we've done so far possible and for their continued leadership as we all keep working to implement this deal and over the coming days I'll remain engage with leaders throughout the Middle East as we all work together to build a better future for the region a future where this kind of violence is Unthinkable a future of all children in the region every child Jewish Muslim Christian Israeli Palestinian Arab grow up knowing only peace that's what we do we're waiting now we just a matter of I thought maybe even as soon as by the time I got here but in the next hour or so we'll know what the second wave of releases are and I'm hopeful that it's as as we anticipate so thank you all for listening I'll take a few questions Mr President when will the first American hostages be released since none were included today we don't know when that will occur but we're going to be expect it to occur and uh we don't know what the list of all the hostages are and when they'll be released but we know the numbers they going to be released so is my hope and expectation will'll be soon and of the time Americans that are unaccounted for do you know all of their conditions are they all alive we don't know all their conditions Mr President how long do you expect this war is going to take and have you encouraged prime minister s timeline say by the end of this year I've encouraged the prime minister to uh to focus on trying to reduce the number of cat while he is attempting to eliminate Hamas which is a legitimate objective he has that's a difficult task and uh I don't know how long it will take my expectation and hope is that as we move forward the rest of the Arab world and the region is also putting pressure on all sides to slow this down to bring this to an end as quickly as we can Mr the chances this TR to be extended by a few days or more I think the chances are real Mr President there are members of your party who would like to see conditions placed on Aid to Israel what is your view on that they would like to see you know induction theing that's well I think that's a worthwhile thought but I don't think if I started off with that we'd ever gotten where we are today we have to take this a piece of the time Mr President do you trust Hamas to uph their I don't trust Hamas to do anything right I only trust Hamas to respond to pressure Mr President you said you were hoping to get cooperation from Arab leaders what are you hearing from them when you talk to them what would you like to see them do I'm hearing a lot but I'm not going to speak to it right now there's an overwhelming desire on the part of the region to let me back up I'm I cannot prove what I'm about to say but I believe one of the reasons why Hamas struck when they did was they knew that I was working very closely with the Saudis and others in the region to bring peace to the region by having recognition of Israel and Israel's right to exist you may recall when we did the G20 about a little while ago I was able to get a resolution a a statement passed through there saying we're going to build a railroad from Riyad all the way through the Middle East into into Saudi Arabia isra is ETC and all the way up to Europe not the not the railroad but it would be an underground Pipeline and then railroad the whole idea is there's overwhelming interest and I think most Arab Nations know it in coordinating with one another to change the dynamic in their region for longer term peace and uh that is uh what I'm going to continue to work on thank you all very very much I appreciate it thank you hi everyone George

list came up short as the Israeli bombing of Gaza intensified President Biden called prime minister M Netanyahu on the 14th of November and urged him to move on the deal but even with the deal ins signed that day it stalled again as Hamas broke off talks that's after Israeli military forces stormed elifa Hospital in Gaza which they claim had served as a Hamas Command Center it took several days for talks to resume again again within a week both sides agreed on the new draft which saw the Israeli cabinet taking its final vote to prove the truth Mo Insight Professor Amos G joins his live from Salt Lake City he is from the college of law in the University of Utah Professor we just heard that a torturous process to get this deal as it is right now but we could also argue that while all lives are valuable the candidates which are up for release on both sides you could say say that both sides might find it easier to justify the release of these particular candidates first of all thank you for having me I think that's correct I think that this first round um the the hostages who will be released are women and children the Palestinian prisoners who will be released have been convicted of various terrorist related crimes but I think you're right from both sides this is um is a first go an easier round I think hope y one hopes that down the road more and more hostages will be released but releasing women and children as you correctly note is a not easy First Step but is a logical First Step so what happens after the 4 days four days is a very long time in any conflict and the Middle East four days could be a lifetime absolutely correct netan promised the extreme right-wing members of his government that the fighting will continue after four days I think there will be pressure from uh President Biden perhaps not to go forward or to slow down the pace and order to give an opportunity to release more hostages I assume the negotiations will continue it's also important to add that in addition to the release of the 50 hostages Thursday Israel time one hopes that indeed the Red Cross will be granted access to the hostages who are still being held that is something that has not yet taken place to the best of my understanding that's absolutely essential to determine what's their condition to ensure their welfare and then we can I really do hope move forward and ultimately release all of the hostages Professor gu as you mentioned Mr Netanyahu has been very clear and I quote him I want to make clear we are at War and we will continue in the war now the release of hostages and a poon fighting to allow essentially your rival your enemy to regroup and to rest is not in the interest of Israel Defense Forces so how does the mindset of allowing for peace just for 4 days allowing for the release of hostages how does that factor into the fact that you are running a war you are returning to the war and the mindset of a war is very different from a ceasefire you're right is so much so that I think it was an hour ago that it's been announced in Israel that some of the reservice who've been called up you know after October 7th and have been there for um what it six seven weeks will be given some um a pass to go home for Tad I don't know how long that will last and that's going to raise questions indeed what you're asking how easy will it be to be resume after four days and if the four days extends to a few more days can you really truly regroup considering that n has promised quote unquote to destroy defeat Hamas I think it's an open question where we go after the four days and I think it's also frankly an open question what kind of pressure Qatar will put on Hamas and on Israel and what kind of pressure President Biden will put on on netan to give more time for more prisoner releases and there is great pressure in Israel on netan to turn the prisoners if you ask me this is not a deal he wanted to make he was forced into it by twin forces of President Biden and the Israeli Republic which understood that there's nothing more important than having Israelis come home safely all right so on the one hand a final question here Professor G uh President Biden on the one hand isra public on the other and we've already heard from from our correspond earlier the national security minister coming out to call this a very bad deal comparing it to the 2011 deal that saw one Israeli soldier being exchanged for a thousand Palestinian prisoners so voices like that in the knesset will they matter when it comes to is Israel keeping to its side of the bargain and perhaps extending this 4day truce so you referenced the um national security minister the police Minister Tamar benir who um initially was opposed to the um release ultimately I think came in voted in favor of it because of Nan's promise that the war will continue benir and his ally the Finance Minister smut uh two extremists opposed it but then voted in favor of it Leto is the prime minister Carrie the day um benir who's truly an extremist um I think here has been outflanked out voted and I think there is an understanding in Israel more that return of the hostages is the single most important issue Ben continue with his propaganda ranting it's not going to carry Force oh thanks that Professor imos G speaking to us live there from Salt Lake City"},

AS WE'VE BEEN REPORTING, THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN DISCUSSING A POTENTIAL HOSTAGE DEAL NOW WITH HAMAS. UNDER THE AGREEMENT, WE UNDERSTAND HAMAS WOULD RELEASE 50 HOSTAGES IN EXCHANGE FOR A TEMPORARY CEASE-FIRE, FUEL, AND THE RELEASE OF PALESTINIAN PRISONERS. EARLIER, PRESIDENT BIDEN SOUNDED CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC. >> WE'RE NOW VERY CLOSE, VERY CLOSE TO BRINGING SOME OF THESE HOSTAGES HOME VERY SOON. BUT I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO DETAILS, NOTHING IS DONE UNTIL IT'S DONE. >> LET'S BRING IN RETIRED NAVY SEAL COMMANDER DAN O'SHEA NOW. HE'S ALSO SERVED AS A COORDINATOR OF THE STATE DEPARTMENTS HOSTAGE WORKING GROUP, AND FROM WHAT WE UNDERSTAND AT THIS EARLY MOMENT, IT'S FOLKS LIKE YOU AND THOSE WORKING IN A DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY WHO CAN PUSH TO GET SOMETHING LIKE THIS EVEN CLOSE TO COMING TO FRUITION. PULL BACK THE CURTAIN A LITTLE BIT, HELP US UNDERSTAND HOW IDEAL LIKE THIS COMES ABOUT WHEN ENTITIES LIKE ISRAEL AND HAMAS DO NOT DIRECTLY COMMUNICATE. >> YES, THAT IS EXACTLY IT. YOU'VE GOT A STATE ACTOR, ISRAEL, THAT WILL NOT SIT ACROSS THE TABLE OF HAMAS. BOTH HAVE THE EAGLES TO WIPE EACH OTHER OUT, THAT'S WHY ALL THESE CONVERSATIONS AND NEGOTIATIONS HAVE BEEN DONE THROUGH BACKDOOR CHANNELS. QATAR HAS COME OUT AS THE SWITZERLAND OF THE MIDDLE EAST, WHEN THESE DEALS HAVE BEEN DONE AT VERY STRATEGIC LEVELS, WITH HIGH PRESSURE FROM DIPLOMATS AND OTHERS. THERE IS 30 PLUS HOSTAGES AROUND THE WORLD, SO YOU HAVE EMBASSIES FROM ACROSS THE WORLD WHO ARE PUTTING PRESSURE NOT ONLY IN TEL AVIV, ON NETANYAHU'S GOVERNMENT, BUT ALSO WORKING ALL CHANNELS. AND THOSE CHANNELS WILL INCLUDE NON GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE RED CROSS, RED CROSS, AND ANY AID ORGANIZATION OFFERED IN GAZA WILL BE PART OF THESE DISCUSSIONS. YOU'LL HAVE RELIGIOUS CLERICS ON BOTH SIDES, FROM GAZA AND ISRAEL, AND IN QATAR. SO VERY COMPLEX, THAT'S WHY THIS IS VERY CHALLENGING AND AGAIN, NO DEAL IS SUCH UNTIL HOSTAGES ARE EXCHANGED AND IT COULD GO PAIR SHAPED AT ANY MOMENT. SO IT'S VERY SENSITIVE, THE FACT THAT OLDEST MEDIA COVERAGE IS FOCUSED ON THIS QUOTE UNQUOTE HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR DO. >> RIGHT. THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT CAVEAT YOU OFFER THEIR. AND AS I MENTIONED YOU ARE MARGARET BRENNAN EARLIER, THE RATIO IS ALSO QUITE NOTEWORTHY. IT WOULD REQUIRE A BIT OF CREATIVITY AMONG THOSE TRYING TO GET TO SOME TYPE OF DEAL, BECAUSE ISRAEL WOULD RELEASE THREE PALESTINIAN PRISONERS FOR EACH HOSTAGE. AND WE UNDERSTAND WOMEN AND CHILDREN ARE BEING PRIORITIZED. WHAT DOES THAT RATIO TELL YOU, CONSIDERING THIS WILL BE A 1 TO 1 EXCHANGE? >> IT COMES DOWN AT THE END OF THE DAY -- ISRAEL VALUES THE LIVES OF EVERY JEWISH CITIZEN, IT'S CRITICAL TO THEM. IT'S CRITICAL TO THEIR SURVIVAL. IN THE PAST, THEY'VE TRADED 1000 PALESTINIAN PRISONERS TO SAVE THE LIFE OF ONE ISRAELI SOLDIER WHO HAD BEEN HELD HOSTAGE FOR FIVE YEARS. SO, THEY PUT THE VALUE OF LIFE ON THEIR CITIZENS AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL, WHERE AS OPPOSED TO HAMAS, THEY USE THEIR CITIZENS AS HUMAN SHIELDS. BUT THE FACT THAT THEY GOT A ONE FOR THREE, CONSIDERING THE PAST, IS -- IT GIVES YOU LIGHT OF WHAT MAY COME IN THE FUTURE. BUT IT'S AGAINST THE IDF POLICY, BECAUSE ARGUABLY 150 pPALESTINIANS RELEASED, IF THEIR MILITARY AGED MALES, THEY'RE GOING TO GET RIGHT BACK IN THE FIGHT. WHICH IS COUNTER TO WHAT THE IDF WANTS TO DO, WHICH IS TO WIPE HAMAS OUT. >> YOU NOTE POLICY HERE, BECAUSE AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND FROM SOME EXTREME ENVIRONMENT TRAINING THAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH, NATIONS LIKE THE U.S. AND THE UK EMPHASIZE TWO JOURNALISTS HEADING TO WAR ZONES AND DIFFICULT AREAS, THAT THOSE NATIONS DON'T NEGOTIATE WITH KIDNAPPERS. THEY DON'T PAY RANSOMS. JOURNALSTS HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN THEY HAD TO CONFLICT ZONES. ARE YOU CONCERNED AT ALL THAT THIS POTENTIAL DEAL ESSENTIALLY SENSE I MESSAGE THAT TAKING HOSTAGES GETS YOU A SEAT AT THE BARGAINING TABLE WITH ISRAEL? >> 100 PERCENT. I MEAN, THE U.S. JUST TRADED SIX BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE RECOVERY OF FIVE IRANIAN AMERICAN HOSTAGES AND EXCHANGED SIX IRANIANS, IN FACT, THAT WAS ANNOUNCED PUBLICLY ON SEPTEMBER 11TH, THIS PAST SEPTEMBER, IRONICALLY ENOUGH. SO OF COURSE HOSTAGE TERRORISM WORKS, AND THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEY DO NEGOTIATE FOR TERRORISTS, AND THAT NOTION THAT WAS THE THING THAT KEPT AMERICA AND OUR CLOSEST ALLIES LIKE THE UK AND AUSTRALIA AND CANADA AND NEW ZEALAND SAFE WAS THAT THE WORD ON THE STREET WAS THIS WAS 15 YEARS AGO, THE U.S. DID NOT NEGOTIATE, DID NOT MAKE CONCESSIONS TO TERRORISTS. NOW WE DO THAT, AND WE'RE SEEING THE EFFECTS. SO YES, THIS DEAL IS GOING TO GET SOME OF THESE HOSTAGES BACK, BUT IT WILL PUT A TARGET ON OTHER INDIVIDUALS TRAVELING, BECAUSE HOSTAGE TERRORISM WORKS. >> THAT IS A SOBERING THOUGHT."}, "ZmrIfeWqNZs": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrIfeWqNZs", "video_id": "ZmrIfeWqNZs", "description": "Weeks of negotiations have led to an agonizing day as talks continue to free some of the nearly 240 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza.

HOW WOULD IT WORK? >> PART OF THE NEGOTIATION IS FOR SAFE PASSAGE FOR THESE HOSTAGES TO GO FROM HAMAS CONTROL INTO ISRAEL. IN THE PAST, A PILOT WAS DONE BY THE U.S., ISRAEL, HAMAS, EGYPT AND QATAR THAT RELEASED TWO AMERICANS. THAT ALLOW THE ICRC TO BRING THE TWO HOSTAGES FROM HAMAS INTO ISRAEL AND HAND THEM OVER TO ISRAELI TROOPS. THE IDEA THIS TIME IS THEY WOULD BE HANDED TO ISRAELI TROOPS AND GO TO HALF A DOZEN HOSPITALS ISRAEL HAS ALREADY IDENTIFIED. MANY WILL NEED MEDICAL ATTENTION. THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SAID THEY HAVE BEEN HELD IN ABHORRENT CONDITIONS. THE PADDING ON THE NATIONALITIES THEY WILL GO AND BE REPATRIATED. IN TOTAL WE BELIEVE AS MANY AS 30 CHILDREN AND 60 WOMEN ARE BEING HELD BY HAMAS. THIS DEAL ONLY ALLOWS FOR 50 OF THEM TO BE RELEASED. . WE ARE NOT SURE WHICH 50. WE ARE ALSO NOT SURE WHICH OF THE 10 AMERICANS WILL BE RELEASED. WE KNOW THERE ARE THREE AMERICANS IN THIS CATEGORY. BEGINNING WITH A THREE-YEAR-OLD. THREE-YEAR-OLD ABIGAIL MOR IDAN. HER PARENTS WERE BOTH KILLED OCTOBER 7. THERE ARE TWO AMERICAN WOMEN BEING HELD. A TOUR GUIDE AT ISRAEL'S HOLOCAUST MUSEUM. AND ANOTHER WOMAN KIDNAPPED IN SOUTHERN GAZA. THAT IS HER. WE DID NOT HAVE THE CONFIRMATION OF WHO EXACTLY WILL BE RELEASED. ANY -- AMNA: ANY NEGOTIATION IS FRAUGHT AND HIGH-STAKES. WHY HAS THIS ONE BEEN SO DIFFICULT? >> ISRAEL IS NOT TALKING TO HAMAS. UNITED STATES IS NOT TALKING TO HAMAS. IN THE MIDDLE ARE QATAR AND EGYPT. THEY HAVE BEEN THE ONE PASSING MESSAGES TO AND FROM ALL THE SIDES. HAMAS I AM TOLD IS NOT ALWAYS RELIABLE. IT IS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. PALESTINIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD HAVE BEEN HOLDING HOSTAGES. SOME ISRAELI OFFICIALS BELIEVE CIVILIANS ARE HOLDING SOME OF THESE HOSTAGES SEPARATE FROM HAMAS. THE OTHER SIDE, THERE HAS BEEN IS RARELY ASSISTANCE. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU IS MEETING WITH HIS GOVERNMENT. THERE HAS BEEN RESISTANCE FROM ESPECIALLY THE FAR RIGHT PARTIES IN THE COALITION TOLD CEASE FIRE AT ALL AS PART OF THE DEAL LET ALONE ANY REDUCTION IN SURVEILLANCE FLIGHTS.

at the outset this is one of the most complicated if not the most complicated hostage case I've seen in 25 to 30 years um the the job for the negotiators is very difficult at this point in time we'd heard from the outset of the case over three weeks ago that almost immediately Qatar was involved Qatar has a very long and successful track record in acting as a third party intermediary in in hostage cases around the world um they were making progress we saw two sets of releases initially to American uh women and then just a few days later two elderly Israeli women so we were seeing progress um at this point in time with um Israel going into Gaza as as your reporter said just a few moments ago um the the sort of the space for negotiation is closing down it won't be closed entirely and um katar turkey I believe Egypt plus the Americans and and Europeans and others who have those held hostage there will be trying every single last Avenue they can think of to try and get as many hostages out as possible what makes these negotiations so complex so this is as I said it's it's pretty much the most complicated case I've ever seen um firstly it's a mass hostage taking that's not totally unheard of but it is highly unusual it's very difficult to hold that number of people without being caught without being found for prolonged period of time um it you know the hostages have been taken into the middle of quite literally a war zone hostage taking usually happens in the gray zones between calm and Chaos where you've just got enough calm to be able to hold people but just enough chaos not not to be found um the the animosity between the two principal negotiate negotiating sides Israel and Hamas is is is is obviously very high not just because of the nature of the the attacks that Hamas mounted but because of a decade decades long um conflict that is ongoing add on to that the regional Dynamics Iran Hezbollah and so on and so forth and plus the interest of uh Western uh governments principally the US which is an incredibly important partner in the region there's so many this is not just a hostage case this is a hostage case a diplomatic crisis um and a war ongoing at the same time so it's as I say I I don't remember a case this complicated in 30 years and what do we know about what both sides are saying they want out of the negotiations well I think things are changing day by day almost hour by hour I mean the you know I don't have any sort of privileged access to what is being said within those negotiations but clearly hamas's position has changed as a result of Israel going in um you know their their sort of scope for negotiation is is is narrowing um they are quite literally on the defensive now um I imagine that the kind of things we've been hearing throughout will still be on the table you know humanitarian relief for the Palestinians release of um those Palestinians who are held in in Israel wider Hamas gains um the the question really is um how much ground Israel is is willing to concede it's it's been through what it is describing as its own 911 I mean it's it's from a distance it's quite difficult to understand just how impacted Israel and Israel's is over over what's happened so very very very difficult and tense negotiations I should imagine meanwhile isra leaders have met with families of the hostages and they're telling them that the more military pressure the more Firepower the more Israel strikes Hamas the greater the chances of getting a solution that will allow the return of loved ones what do you make of this approach well I mean it's the hostages to start with are in a perilous situation whether Israel goes go in or not um I imagine that is the Israeli government is is making a calculation about the position it finds itself in now and you know what is it that is going to um create the conditions that that brings Hamas closer to the table you know the the thing that worries me in this situation this isn't unique to this but it's very much heightened in this situation given what's happening on the ground is that agitated and anxious hostage takers are often highly unpredictable and so I worry that the closer that Israel goes in the closer that Israel gets physically to Hamas and and those hostages you have hostage takers who are running on adrenaline anyway who um are then uh more likely to to react in unpredictable way so I I very much hope that the Israelis are proceeding with an element of caution at this point in time and what's the likelihood of some sort of ceasefire being part of the negotiations yeah I mean it's it's it's difficult to say I mean certainly there are so many different parties um calling for that um I'm I'm not quite sure the the extent to which there's an appetite for that from the Israeli side I mean as I said they are they you know the attacks that were inflicted on them on 7th of October were extraordinary they were barbaric they were completely inexcusable so um you know on the Israeli side um they are tired of this they want to bring an end to Hamas um and um it's you know tensions are high on all sides so I I'm not entirely sure there's the appetite from their side but at the same time we have got growing pressure on them from you know United Nations the US the UK and and so on and so forth and you know right from the outset Western allies were there in lock step with with Israel trying to calm the situation as much as possible amongst other things so I hope at some point that um something will happen that will allow a to to get into the Palestinians because as your reporter said just a few minutes ago the situation for ordinary Palestinians living in Gaza is is absolutely critical right now and as you say um time is really important here or a limiting factor realistically what do you think can be achieved in negotiations at the moment yeah so I I would I would say it's really really important that even as perilous and difficult as this situation is that we don't give up hope um I've worked on and around hundreds of Hostage cases over the last 30 years and the number of times that you think it's just impossible for that individual or that group of individuals to get themselves out of that particular situation because of how difficult it is because of how entrenched both sides are on the negotiation position and yet we have been surprised I mean a good friend and mentor of mine Terry White who was held for five years in in bayout by by hbot he um you know his family were told a year into his captivity that categorically he is dead and yet just a few years later he he came out um alive and well so it's you know these these situations are never easy they're never straightforward um but I think with as many sort of positive brains around the table as I know we have now um we should always remain hopeful that there there can and there I hope will be um further releases of hostages in in the days and weeks ahead Rachel Briggs thank you so much for talking to us on the world we really appreciate your time thank you"}, "6Xysn3mWdhQ": {"url":

provide a full list of every hostage in Gaza their name nationality everything but Hamas said it couldn't provide such a list unless the bombing stopped because hostages were so spread out and being held by different groups to quote the guardian that suggested even Hamas leaders do not know for sure how many people are held captive their locations or the number who have survived the bombardments then there's the logistical challenge of organizing a hostage exchange on this scale through a Labyrinth of tunnels scattered below cities under constant bombardment in this video prepared and released by Hamas in the case of two Americans released on October 20th Cotter helped arrange for the Red Cross to meet Hamas in Gaza then once safely across to Israel the Army the IDF took them in to discuss what they'd seen to reunite them with family and to connect them with US Embassy officials now Israel and and Hamas will have to do that many times over several days on both sides for every hostage released Israel has promised to release three Palestinians from Israeli jails that back and forth transfer is extremely delicate it is a concern frankly uh about how they will be transported uh how long that process will take so there are whole series of concerns that have to do uh um with the capacity of some of these hostages to survive Franklin even as the two sides were discussing a break in the fighting Israeli aerial bombardment continued The Siege on the ground continued and both sides were clear about just how transactional this truce would be Israel's aim dismantle Hamas and stopping before then nety who says he nonsense Hamas was similarly provocative with its language we affirm that our hands will remain on the trigger they said in a statement the Rockets bullets and bombs may stop Flying for a time but both sides are undoubtedly thinking ahead to when the fighting resumes and unlike what we often see in ceasefires there will be no troop pullback Israel's tanks armored vehicles soldiers that are already Behind Enemy Lines inside Gaza they'll stay in Gaza during the troops what could go badly wrong is if there is even a minor violation of the ceasefire uh either by Hamas or by the Ida in responding to a local incident maintaining a truce in an otherwise active Battle Zone requires immense discipline from every individual Soldier and right up the chain of command any violation of the truth even a perceived violation risks exploding the whole situation every time you break a ceasefire it's more difficult um to reestablish these negotiations were arduous and painstaking teams would have to read assemble to try to solve a problem which is frankly very difficult to solve that there are no stable lines for either the audf or Hamas to withdraw [Music] [Music] to [Music] for Netanyahu has been under tremendous domestic pressure to prioritize the rescue of hostages over the bombardment of Gaza but with a truce now agreed upon there are those within netanyahu's government who are fiercely opposed to any pause in fighting this is itamar benir he is the leader of a far-right political party called Jewish power he's openly called for the expulsion of disloyal Palestinian citizens in Israel he is a provocator who has led several visits and marches to the Temple Mount to assert Jewish Authority on a site sacred to Muslims where only Muslims are allowed to pray and today he happens to be netanyahu's national security minister he and other members of his party opposed the truce and in fact he reportedly called for the offensive in Gaza to intensify to secure better terms now this is not to say that the truce is in Jeopardy they have no capacity to influence the outcome they were the only ones to oppose doesn't matter because the majority of the parliament is in favor of this so they're irrelevant but it is worth pointing out the Netanyahu Coalition is not one homogeneous singularly unified body there are many things on which they disagree including how best to achieve the goal goal of eliminating Hamas so where does this leave the truth it is intended to last at least through the weekend with the possibility of daily extensions for every 10 additional hostages Hamas releases then once the truce expires both sides seem pretty transparent each wants to eliminate the other so the war will continue"},

I KNOW YOU'VE REMAINED A PART OF THIS GROUP OF FAMILIES IN REGULAR CONTACT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. WHAT WERE THE KEY QUESTIONS YESTERDAY FOR JAKE SULLIVAN, AND DO YOU FEEL YOU GOT ANSWERS? >> WELL, THANK YOU, FIRST, FOR HAVING ME, AND I THINK THE KEY QUESTIONS WERE JUST ABOUT THE NEWS THAT WE HAVE BEEN HEARING THAT'S BEING REPORTED, IS IT ACCURATE, AND ARE THE NEGOTIATIONS AS INTENSE AS WE ARE TOLD THEY ARE. AND I THINK THAT THIS GAVE MR. SULLIVAN AN OPPORTUNITY AND MR. McGURK WAS IN THE ROOM AS WELL TO GIVE US A LITTLE BIT OF A FEELING OF WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE NEGOTIATIONS BUT NOT TO GIVE US THE DETAILS OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T. I THINK IT WAS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. WE MET WITH MR. SULLIVAN TEN DAYS AGO, AND HE WAS COMMITTED TO MEETING WITH US AGAIN, AND THIS GAVE THESE FAMILIES, THERE ARE EIGHT AMERICAN HOSTAGES, SIX WHO WE KNOW ARE ALIVE, AND IT GAVE US AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO TALK ABOUT AND FOR THESE FAMILIES TO SHARE AND FOR MR. SULLIVAN AND MR. McGURK TO JUST HEAR THE PAIN OF THESE FAMILIES, BUT ALSO TO GIVE THEM SOME UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE'S CAUTIOUS SMIRK THAT THERE IS A DEAL AND -- CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM THAT THERE IS A DEAL, AND THEY HAVE TAKEN THAT MEETING WITH US IN A BUSY TIME, AND ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MR. SULLIVAN TO REAFFIRM THE 24/7 COMMITMENT OF HIMSELF, PRESIDENT BIDEN, SECRETARY BLINKEN, THE ADMINISTRATION, AND THE RELEASING OF THE 136 HOSTAGES IS THEIR TOP PRIORITY. >> ON ONE HAND, WE ARE HEARING THIS OPTIMISM, OUR REPORTERS IN THE FIELD ARE HEARING THAT OPTIMISM, BUT JUST YESTERDAY, PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU EXPLICITLY RULED OUT TWO KEY HAMAS DEMANDS, NO PULL OUT FROM GAZA, NO EXCHANGE OF PALESTINIAN PRISONERS AS HOSTAGES, AND HE SAID FLAT OUT, NONE OF THAT WILL HAPPEN. HOW ARE YOU AND THE OTHER FAMILIES FEELING ABOUT THE APPROACH? >> WE'RE THE FAMILY MEMBERS, AND FOR US THIS IS A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS. WHAT I CAN SAY IS WHAT WE HEAR ON THE NEWS AND SOME OF THE POSTURING, WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A SERIOUS COMMITMENT ON THE ISRAELIS' BEHALF AND ALL OF THESE PEOPLE, THE EGYPTIANS, THE QATARIS WITH THE AMERICANS IN NEGOTIATING FOR THE RELEASE OF THESE HOSTAGES. WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT IT'S A NEGOTIATION, SO THERE'S PEOPLE HAVING TO GIVE IN AND TO GET, AND FOR US, THE ONLY THING THAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO AS FAMILIES IS THE RELEASE OF THESE HOSTAGES AND JUST TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT ON OCTOBER 7th OVER 1,200 PEOPLE WERE MURDERED. 40 OF THEM WERE AMERICANS. TOO WERE HOSTAGES, AND THERE'S STILL 136 PEOPLE THAT REMAIN IN GAZA. AND THE LAST THING FOR PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU TO WANT WOULD BE HIS LEGACY TO BE WHAT HAPPENED ON OCTOBER 7th. I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE WHAT ANY LEADER WOULD WANT TO HAVE THAT ABSOLUTE FAILURE OF SECURITY TO BE HIS LEGACY. AND RIGHT NOW, HIS LEGACY IS BASED ON BRINGING BACK THESE HOSTAGES AND FINDING A WAY FOR ISRAEL TO MOVE FORWARD, AND THE ONLY WAY ISRAEL MOVES FORWARD IS IF THESE HOSTAGES ARE RELEASED, AND THEY HAVE TO BE RELEASED SOON. >> LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT ONE PARTICULAR HOSTAGE WHO WAS RELEASED AND I KNOW YOU'RE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT RESPECTING ABIGAIL'S PRIVACY, BUT IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN SHARE AT THIS POINT ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE IN CAPTIVITY AND TELL US HOW SHE'S DOING NOW? >> WELL, THANK YOU FOR ASKING, AND, YES, WE ARE VERY VERY CAUTIOUS BECAUSE SHE'S A 4-YEAR-OLD. LOOK, WE UNDERSTAND THAT FOR 50 DAYS SHE AND THE OTHERS WERE PRETTY MUCH SILENCED. AND YOU IMAGINE A 4-YEAR-OLD WHO'S RUNNING AROUND AND BASICALLY NOT ABLE TO RUN AROUND, NOT ABLE TO LAUGH, NOT ABLE TO CRY. AND THAT WAS HER EXPERIENCE. SAYING MORE THAN THAT, WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT SHE WAS BLESSED TO COME HOME ON THE 50th DAY. IT WAS A MIRACLE. I MEAN, THESE HOSTAGES NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HAVE BEEN GONE 117 DAYS, IT'S MORE THAN DOUBLE. AND WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT ABIGAIL IS A ENERGETIC, BEAUTIFUL, REALLY INTELLIGENT LITTLE 4-YEAR-OLD WHO HAS RETURNED TO BE WITH THE FAMILY AFTER HER PARENTS WERE MURDERED. BUT SHE GETS TO GO TO SCHOOL AND SHE PLAYS, AND, YOU KNOW, I WILL JUST SAY THAT FOR OUR FAMILY, ABIGAIL RETURNING GAVE US THE ABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD. OTHER HOSTAGE FAMILIES, UNTIL THEIR RELATIVES ARE BACK, THEY CANNOT MOVE FORWARD, AND I SAY THAT FOR THE NATION BECAUSE ISRAEL IS SUCH A SMALL COUNTRY AND PEOPLE ARE ALL RELATED. THAT UNTIL THESE 136 PEOPLE, HOSTAGES RETURN, IT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ISRAEL TO MOVE FORWARD. WE ARE BLESSED, AND I'M HERE BECAUSE EVERYBODY WORKED REALLY HARD TO MAKE SURE THERE WAS A FORMULA TO BRING OUT THE FIRST HOSTAGES AND WE'RE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING TO MAKE SURE THE SECOND GROUP COMES OUT AND THEY ALL COME OUT SO THAT THE BLEZ BLESSING OF HAVING ABIGAIL HOME WITH US, THIS BEAUTIFUL 4-YEAR-OLD, WE WANT TO HAVE A BEAUTIFUL LIFE, AFTER EVERYTHING, WE WANT THAT SAME FOR ALL OF THESE OTHER FAMILIES. >> WELL, FROM A PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE, I THINK AFTER EVERYTHING YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH, THE WAY YOU ARE STANDING BY THESE FAMILIES, WHICH CAN ONLY PROVIDE A BEACON OF HOPE FOR"}, "4ocPUunzfHY": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ocPUunzfHY", "video_id": "4ocPUunzfHY", "description": "The Israeli military says its forces have advanced deep into the Gaza Strip and are \"at the gates of Gaza City\".

somebody will use his own children as human Shields but so we're going door to door and they they're hiding in the terror tunnels um so it makes it a very difficult fight and but we have to go on it will take apparently some time but the end result can only be one which is eliminating Hamas military capabilities in order to make sure uh what happened on October 7th will never happen again overnight several un special rapur issued a statement saying they're concerned that Palestinians are at grave risk of genocide very strong statement from the United Nations overnight what would be your response to that Mr Leed well we are worried as well and but the question should be directed at Kamas not at us we didn't initiate this we didn't want this war we're protecting our own people against a a murderous Terror organization that is is killing the innocent and and uh we have no other choice what are we supposed to do what would Australia do if somebody will invade its territory and kill babies the elderly women and and and civil innocent civilian so yes I think I think the people of Gaza are in bual as of as the as the the same as the people of Israel or we are all being threatened and killed by a terror organization there has been International condemnation of the bombing of the refugee camp uh how were people in that refugee camp able to move away before that bombing many children there we understand have been killed in that bombing did Israel do enough to ensure that civilians were protected well first of all I would be very careful with with the reports coming from Gaza because Hamas controls the report and they've been lying all along I you know I assume the example of the hospital they told everybody it was bombed by the Israelis and 500 people were killed it turned out it wasn't bombed by the Israelis and 50 people were killed so uh um I mean I mean if if a terror organization that is killing babies do you think it will be beneath them to lie in reports so we have to be very careful about the reports again we are fighting Hamas in a very dense populated area and and there's going to be casualties of course we are sorry we have no fight with babies we have no fight with with uh civilians we're doing our best to avoid hurting the civilians this exactly the difference between a terror organization and a law-abiding uh Democratic country but the war is a war I mean I mean you we saw the kind of casualties we had fighting Isis mean we meaning the civilized word and we have the same uh uh problems fighting Hamas these are very very organizations I'm sorry to interrupt the IDF has confirmed though that it it was responsible for both those strikes on the refugee camp say again the IDF has confirmed that it was responsible for both those strikes on the refugee camp though yeah yeah I didn't say we didn't bomb the refugee camp I just said that you have to be careful with the reports about the number of casualties and who who were uh who who they were I I I'm I'm not saying for a second that this is not a war and this we don't have casualties in this war this is part of the of the problem fighting a ter organization that's using his own people as human Shields people find it very hard to digest this this concept of human Shields of using your own children as a weapon in in a war but so so we find it sometimes it's very hard to explain this again I'm saying I'm I'm acknowledging the fact that the innocent suffering and I'm urging you to direct the questions about it to Hamas Mr our prime minister Anthony albanesi has said that uh Israel certainly has the right to defend itself but he is concerned that the civilian toll and indeed other International leaders are concerned about the growing civilian toll in Gaza is Israel heeding these International concerns yes but I I'm not sure we need this because we are are concerned to begin with this is not something we want to do this is not a war we wanted to be engaged in this is this we were this was forced upon us and part of the problem we have uh uh going into this war is the fact that we want to do our best in order to avoid hurting civilian the civilians who are and and the bystanders so so I appreciate the fact that the Australian government has a moral stand we share the same moral stand we don't want to hurt those people and uh um right now both Israelis and the people of Gaza are victims of Hamas"}, "rJoQUFaQGMQ": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJoQUFaQGMQ", "video_id": "rJoQUFaQGMQ", "description": "Hundreds are feared dead or

been killed just want to show you those still images as well that we've had in and this is pictures that we've had which have been verified of this Hospital the Al Ali Hospital in the center of the Gaza Strip following that air strike well let's talk to our correspondent John Don and who is following all the developments in Gaza John welcome to you little information coming into us just bring us up to date on what we do know about these reports of a strike on this Hospital well look certainly at this stage it looks to be one of the most deadly attacks of this conflict so far it's very difficult to get an accurate picture of the numbers at this stage this is the uh Hospital run by the Baptist Church it's right in the center of uh Gaza City close to the main Square uh we've seen the first images coming in uh showing buildings on fire and as you say in terms of numbers we've got the civil defense Authority in Gaza talking about 300 people being killed and the health Ministry saying 500 but I should say at this stage uh it's difficult really for anyone to know but we're getting images of the injured being uh rushed to hospital in Gaza other hospitals I mean you have to remember that at this time there will have been hundreds if not thousands of people displaced from their homes Sheltering in this Hospital uh thinking it was a safe place we have contacted the Israeli Defense Force uh for comment but we've not heard back yet and just give us a sense of the geography you said it's in central Gaza and you described it as being run by the Baptist Church so this would have been very well known um a location as a hospital yeah absolutely certainly everyone in Gaza would have known uh where it was it's actually not that far from the BBC office in Gaza I've walk past it at many times when I was working there uh and it's uh you know there's not a large Christian population in Gaza but this was run by uh the Baptist Church so every hospital uh in Gaza at the moment is not just a place where they're treating thousands of casualties it's also a place where people are seeking shelter we've seen the pictures from shifa hospital also in Gaza City where you got thousands of people camped out in the hospital and in the hospital grounds and we think it will have been the same there yeah and just looking uh for any kind of reaction from Israel and as you mentioned no response as yet do you think we can expect one fairly soon well they're going to be being asked uh what happened uh was this a mistake were they targeting someone or something specific uh in that hospital or below that hospital uh they're going to be at being asked because of course we've got uh Joe Biden arriving tomorrow and the Americans have been urging uh Israel to limit the number of Civilian casualties and if Joe Biden arrives here tomorrow morning and we're getting confirmation that we've got people having been killed in their hundreds in a hospital uh in in an apparent Israeli air strike then um that presumably is not going to go down very well yeah and give us a sense of I mean how many people may possibly have been there I know it's impossible for you to say exactly but given that so many people have been displaced and they have been moving to places of what they think is safety like hospitals like schools yeah I mean look we know that about 600,000 people have uh moved South after that warning from Israel to evacuate their homes uh last week but there are lots of people who can't move or didn't want to move you know the injured the vulnerable uh people in hospital they can't move so a lot of people have been uh just heading to anywhere they think is uh relatively safe though that that could be schools it could be un facilities it could be hospitals we know that we've also heard this evening uh that a un school has been hit in the center of Gaza City six people killed there including some un staff and the United Nations body there in Gaza calling that uh strike outrageous we've got people just packed into anywhere they think might be safe apparently in the south of Gaza near Rafa you've got 8,000 PE people packed into a warehouse with very very limited facilities so people are going anywhere that they think was safe but a hospital not even a hospital is a safe place yeah John Hamas of uh released a statement calling the attack on the hospital in the Gaza Strip a war crime it said the hospital was housing hundreds of sick and wounded and P people forcibly displaced from their homes as a result of other strikes the statement

militant group Hamas launched more than 2,000 Rockets into the country killing at least 200 people and wounding nearly a thousand officials in the Gaza Strip say at least 198 people have been killed there in retaliatory Israeli strikes The Barrage of Rocket fire from Gaza into Israeli territory began just after Dawn with explosions heard on the streets of ashalon s darat is one of the towns thought to have been infiltrated by militants with the latest on this fast escalating conflict his our Middle East correspondent you land now and a warning you may find some of her report upsetting Israeli party goers from an overnight Rave running for their lives Israel's nightmare scenario armed Palestinian militants at large in southern Israel it's thought that dozens entered some cutting through the perimeter fence from the Gaza Strip in the town of stot residents hid as Fighters drove in there was shooting and the Israeli casualties began to mount in a dramatic turn videos were also shared of Israelis being taken into Gaza as hostages the day had begun with intense barrages of Palestinian Rockets some reaching as far as Jerusalem but the worst damage was in the town's closest to Gaza this was ashalon Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu met top security officials since this morning the state of Israel has has been at War our first objective is to clear out enemy forces that infiltrated and restore the security and quiet the communities that have been attacked the second objective at the same time is to exact an immense price from the Enemy Within the Gaza Strip too leaders of Hamas the islamist militant Group which controls Gaza now living overseas was shown watching the unfolding news and praying in Gaza there were celebrations after an Israeli tank was captured and stolen Israeli military vehicles were driven in but soon the deadly pounding by Israeli war planes began the Israeli military saying it was targeting Hass sites and in Gaza 2 the hospitals have now been overwhelmed many Palestinian families have fled from their homes and are seeking safety in un run schools after this unprecedented surprise attack Israel is calling up military reservists it said Hamas will pay the price for its actions and the fighting goes on the question now can it be stopped from spreading to other Palestinian areas and The Wider region youan now there will let's bring you the latest figures coming into us from Gaza the health Ministry have told the BBC there that 232 people have been killed and 1,790 have been injured well let's go live now to our Jerusalem Bureau bureau chief Joe floto who's following all the developments and Joe also in the past few minutes confirmation from the Israelis that at least 200 Israelis have been killed in those attacks today bring us the latest yeah so the the casualty figures coming up on both sides there there's still fighting going on so we're just coming off of an Israeli military briefing and they're confirming that there is ongoing gun gunfire in some of their military installations and border crossing points on the Gaza Strip which uh has taken them hours to retake and they still haven't completed that process they estimate that hundreds of militants managed to break out of Gaza and storm several locations near the Gaza Strip in Israeli towns and we've seen this chaos unfold during the morning hours with people being taken hostage a number of people killed and we've seen extraordinary videos of Israeli civilians being dragged away by militants supposedly into the Gaza Strip and we can confirm that there are dozens we think of hostages now being ta held by militants in Gaza H there's there's so much to talk about Joe um I just want to ask you about the military operation because also in the past few minutes the Reuters news agency were reporting a military spokesperson Israeli military spokesperson saying we are prepared for an escalation in the north now um geography wise a lot of these attacks happened in the south of the country what do you think that's going to mean what they're doing there is trying to reassure people and send out a message to Israel's enemies outside the country that they are prepared for a war on several fronts the main concentration of military effort at the moment is in the Gaza Strip so they are amassing hundreds and thousands of soldiers they've called up reservist and they are preparing for a big ground operation into the Gaza Strip they've made no secret of that it will take them a while to plan that in the meantime they are bombing Gaza Strip and that hence the casualties that we're seeing being reported out of Gaza but to the north of the country is Lebanon and Hezbollah is a well-known militant organization that runs pretty well that country and controls the large area of the south of that country and has had a war with Israel in the past and they have voiced their support for Hamas today and within their control within the the the areas of control of Hezbollah are also Palestinian milit milit factions who have in the past fired Rockets out of Lebanon into Israel so Israel Israeli military is saying they are prepared for any eventuality but make no mistake what they're planning at the moment is a massive attack on the Gaza Strip using thousands and thousands of soldiers we just don't know when that's going to happen Okay and politically Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has in the last 20 minutes or so said he's invited the opposition leaders ya lapid and Gant to join a national Unity government what's that going to mean well I think at times like this in Israel you often get very very Stark political differences set aside uh for the sake of national unity and that's what we've seen this evening this evening those politic those opposition figur really don't like Netanyahu they've they've been bitter political Rivals but they are going to sit in a national Unity government Benny gance is a very very senior military offic former Chief of Staff and will for part of that government but this is a a very divided country at the moment politically we've seen protests continue for most of this year because of U of political um decisions made by Netanyahu that haven't been agreed with by lots of the population here but at the moment this country is reeling in the shock of of what has never been seen by many many people living in Israel you have to go back probably to the Yom kapore War about 50 years ago before you get anything remotely close to this if you think about the war between Hezbollah and Gaza in 2006 we've already surpassed that death toll on the Israeli side in just one day and in in that situation we only had a tiny infiltration into Israel proper this is something different this is something that the Israeli military was supposed to stop this is not a surprise that Hamas have wanted to do this it is a surprise that they did it today and in such numbers and complete surprise is that they were so effortlessly successful for hours and hours and have reached havoc and now they hold in their possession we think dozens of hostages both military and civilian"}, "sg6MPe-eRnk": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg6MPe-eRnk", "video_id": "sg6MPe-eRnk", "description": "Hamas said one of the top leaders of its armed

Palestinians are said to have been killed and more than 2,000 injured and worry is also deepening over the shocking hostage taking of more than 100 Israelis who are now said to have been taken to Gaza our first report tonight is from our defense correspondent Jonathan Beal who brings us all the latest and I should warn you that in his report report there are images that you may find distressing Israeli troops are still hunting down armed Palestinians more than 30 hours after their biggest and bloodiest breakout from Gaza into Israel itself one of the world's most advanced militaries taken by surprise by Hamas a militant group kept behind barriers that were supposed to stop this happening their attack as brutal as it was Brazen hundreds killed for Israel that's included scores of unarmed civilians as well as soldiers already the largest loss of life in decades here the bodies of an Israeli family shot dead waiting to be identified and buried Hamas has taken dozens of host ages too like this 85-year-old grandmother yafa Adar whisked Away by militants in a golf card families too among them yon's wife and their five and 2-year-old daughters he's left anxiously waiting for news and pleading for their safe return I want to ask of Kamas don't hurt them don't hurt little children don't hurt women if you want me instead I'm willing to come Israel's prime minister meeting security Chiefs this morning has warned his nation of a long and difficult War ahead both sides have already suffered significant losses Hamas murdered hundreds of Israelis men women and children and took dozens host St into Gaza this horrific terror act Demands a forceful determined and sustained response Israel's response has been Swift and harsh despite the massive intelligence Failure Its missiles filmed by our BBC team in Gaza Jets have been hitting what they say a Hamas positions but many civilians have also been killed in this densely populated Palestinian enclave blockaded and nowhere else to flee tonight this is as close as we can get to Gaza itself about 5 kilm in that direction there is a lot of military activity Jets overhead Israel has told its citizens living nearby to leave it's not clear whether that could signal a land incursion by Israel into Gaza itself but inevitably this will end up being more bloody still there's also the risk of escalation Hezbollah has been firing Rockets into Israel from neighboring Lebanon they say a show of solidarity with Palestinians this region has long been a Tinder Box and once again the Flames are being fanned Jonathan Beal BBC News Southern Israel and tonight Israel search and rescue committee has confirmed that more than 250 bodies have been recovered from the sight of a music festival which had been taking place close to the

your political security and Military failure on October the 7th there was no Army no one arrived and no one protected us we are innocent civilians who pay taxes to Israel we are in captivity in a bad condition you are killing us the captive woman goes on to say release us now release their citizens release their prisoners release all of us let us go back to our families Let's cross over to Sarah kyat our correspondent whose life is in occupied East Jerusalem there's a reason we're not showing that video as is Sara it's part of you might say policy to protect the identity as well of the captives uh but it's very Stark it's very graphic and it's very to the point absolutely it's extraordinary actually uh to see this there was no warning that this video would be released and the accusations from uh one of the three captives three women in their I'd say middle-aged um she really was uh uh uh criticizing Netanyahu and you know some of the things she said was extraordinary she blamed him uh for the failure of October 7 attack for preventing it from happening for saying that no Army was present no one came to help us uh we're innocent citizens um she said that uh she put posed the question are you wanting to kill all of us do you does you do you want the military to kill us um because of your failure and the deaths already she's obviously referring to those killed because of the uh Hamas attack is this not enough she says release us now release their prisoners and their uh citizens of course she's referring uh to uh the request that was made by Hamas to release um all of the Palestinian prisoners uh if um if that was to happen if Israel went through with this they would then immediately release all of the C it's all for all as some of the family members here have been asking prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to consider I will say though we it's not clear of course whether these were her own words whether she was coerced into this she seemed very angry uh but usually in these situations it's difficult to tell um what we do know though is that family members here in Israel to those held captive or even those missing have for days been been demanding from the Israeli government to give them answers they've pleaded with them to uh find a solution to bringing back uh those family family members as soon as possible because of course with Israel uh attacking Gaza and especially that that turnaround in the last three or four days um they are really concerned for uh the survival of their relatives in fact um supposed to be happening around this time is a meeting with the foreign uh minister his that video it seems uh potentially may have been filmed yesterday um and that's because in that video she refers to a meeting between prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and uh families of those held captive which was the day before yesterday um how much of that information they have they been able to see have they had access to local Israeli media it's difficult to tell or were they given that information again very hard to tell um but it seems to uh if if it's going to do anything potentially put more pressure on a government um that you know where there are calls in Israel increasingly to consider that option of uh exchange which is uh uh you know for to exchange those uh prisoners Palestinian prisoners to release them in exchange for releasing the captives um you know this is a time when uh prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been criticized a lot in terms of reaction here uh of course this is only just coming out uh in the last 20 minutes or so what we are seeing is that Israeli media most of it hasn't covered this yet uh but one of the main channels was discussing it and um they've already said that this is a propaganda video they've called it Hamas using psychological warfare to terrorize uh the families of those being held captive so uh uh certainly we'll have to see how that they react and of course you know whether we'll get an official um uh response from the government here but already people on social media in Israel uh the media is calling it a propaganda video and they concerned to me it seems like this is Hamas increasing that pressure they'd already said uh uh even last week that they were willing to release more captives they'd accused the Israeli government not not of not listening to them and ignoring them Israel had for a long the longest time since uh this attack that happened on October the 7th um said that they won't mediate with Hamas and it was not even an option and then you had Qatar the US and Egypt all working behind the scenes uh on a possible uh uh ceasefire option for Hamas that they had requested initially in exchange for releasing more of those captives then in the last few days as Israel increased its bombardment of Gaza they then asked and said that they would immediately release all of those if 6,000 Plus uh Palestinian prisoners were released this is a really interesting uh development very unexpected um but we'll have to see where uh this moves on from here Sarah KY there forest in occupied East Jerusalem thank you"}, "SIqVEi2spW4": {"url":

released video of three of those captives it's holding in Gaza they are heard criticizing the Israeli Prime Minister Benin Netanyahu and they call on the government to release Palestinians held in Israeli prisons in exchange for captives let's hear now from AKA Elder who's a contributor to heret newspaper joins us live now from Tel Aviv uh for this perspective from Israel and AA this video it's it's highly emotive and uh played by Hamas for full political gain described by Netanyahu as cruel psychological propaganda how is it being received in Israel it comes Nick in the middle of uh a huge campaign uh right now it is started starting next to my house there is an objective Israeli soldier who by the way has uh an American passport his uh father met with uh President Biden when he was here and uh visited also New York and uh I think that what you see now in the streets in Tel Aviv and elsewhere uh is just the tip of uh the iceberg uh just to remind you Nick in 20 2006 an Israeli soldier was abducted gilad sh shal and until 2011 for five years there was a huge campaign and uh we're talking about a single Israeli soldier now just compare it to what's happening now with women 30 little children abducted uh the Israeli public opinion is divided between those who believe that Israel should pay any price and you mentioned releasing the uh Palestinian prisoner for Gil Shalit Israel released 1,000 Hamas prisoners including isma hania uh on the other hand there are people like for instance uh in his press conference nany said that when he was asked about the Gil shal deal that actually he admitted that uh this was a mistake he should uh review this policy again well so do you think there's a sense that the captives that are held in Gaza and their safety or not perhaps how is it being factored in by the military planners of the ongoing assault the uh uh message which is coming out of the Israeli government is uh if you would uh to put it in a slogan is that we are going to destroy the Hamas as if we don't have to care about the captives and we'll do everything to get out the capus as if we uh don't have to destroy Kamas and uh actually Nick it's it's a paradox because the Israeli Army and even Netanyahu knows that uh every day that passes with uh those children and women in jail and while Israel is striking both from the air and from the ground the chances to get them out are getting uh little and little uh and uh the pressure from the public opinion is greater now as netan said in reaction to the release of this video he said it's a kind of uh a psychological propaganda yes and uh promise those women that Israel will do its best but what they also said they asked for a ceasefire and this is something that Netanyahu with his popularity uh is not able to do right now because he promised not to stop until he will put an end to the Hamas and this may take months if not more than a year right so he's already under a lot of pressure as you've been alluding to uh so really this just Stacks it up even more yeah uh and uh there are mothers who uh are writing articles for instance there was an article today in the AR that they cry for their children and uh in in the Israeli public opinion rescuing captives let alone children and women is sacred it's more important than everything so these generals who on television are trying to explain the public opinion that uh well uh this is a sacrifice that we have to do in order to make sure that uh the Hamas will not do this again and the Hamas knows that the Israeli public opinion is very fragile and they are doing what I expected them to do they are using this merchandise human merchandise in a way uh and uh they will put more and more pressure both on the Israeli public opinion the United States because there are more than 20 American citizens there are French there are th in order to get what they want and what they want at the beginning was to get their prisoners back home but now they're looking for something else they are looking for their own Survival and the survival of the Hamas and this is something that Nan politically cannot afford and AA one more thing what what's the general sense of public opinion the mood in Israel of course the anger about October the 7th runs very very very deep but what is the overall sense do you think I imagine it's polarized but sense about the scale of Israeli bombardment and and the mass deaths that we've been seeing within Gaza yeah Nick I'm afraid that uh the public opinion in Israel is moving more and more to the right and you can see it even in uh what's happening between Israeli Jews and Israeli Arabs the an attack on dormitories in natania where there are Israeli Arabs who are living there the police is arresting Israeli Palestinians for ins ments on social media U it's now becoming a kind of a zero some game it's us or there and there is no mercy because uh if uh you pity the Palestinians at the end you will pay the price so it's actually a battle on the narrative and right now the narrative in Israel is that we are the victims and all Hamas people all sorry all the people of God they supported Hamas they deserve it unfortunately this is the mood right now n all right we'll leave it there for the moment do you appreciate your analysis AA that's AA Elder a contributor to heret newspaper joining us from Tel Aviv

that the UN said could be a war crime the disputed death toll is between dozens and hundreds in Northern Gaza the Israeli offensive has increased there has been another strike outside the alus hospital it is now home to 14,000 people this picture is from the Palestinian red crescent the Israeli Defense Force is yet to confirm but they are on the ground in Northern Gaza as seen in their videos those displaced from this part of Gaza had been told to move South and the main road would be safe to use for 3 hours today but among displaced Palestinians there was little trust Israel would keep its word if there is hope for a diplomatic solution US Secretary Anthony blinkin is in Jordan where there is an absence of consensus with these Arab leaders we are still asking for an immediate ceasefire and for Israel to stop hindering the delivery of humanitarian Aid we are also demanding an international investigation into this violation of international law it's our view that uh ceasefire now would simply leave Hamas in place able to regroup and repeat what it did on October 7th and you don't have to take my word for it just a few days ago a senior homas officials said that it was their intent to do October 7th again and again and again so where next for this conflict Israel currently rejects a ceasefire whilst Hamas remain in Gaza with Israeli hostages yet the US now support a brief humanitarian Paws and is preparing the ground for when the fighting ends yet nobody can see just how or when that will be Simon Brown reporting well our International editor Lindsay hilsum is with me now again it's good to see you again Lindsay Anthony blinkin the US Secretary of State has been a very busy man he's back in Jordan today meeting all these Arab foreign ministers as we just said what's he trying to achieve and what will he achieve well his version of events is slightly different from their version of events I would say what he said earlier today was that the Arab leaders agreed with the Americans that Hamas may not must not rule Gaza again in the future but we haven't heard them say that and in fact the Jordanian foreign minister was um was railing against the Israelis in very strong language for what he called war crimes and saying that this must stop and there must be a ceasefire immediately and of course the Americans don't want to ceasefire immediately they say that there should be humanitarian pauses 3 to 12 hours those yet have they they haven't had anything like that and then at the same time you've got another complication in Gaza which is Hamas apparently according to the Egyptians and the Americans stopping both the wounded and foreigners from leaving because they were apparently trying to get wounded Hamas Fighters out and that wasn't supposedly part of the plan so you have that disagreement there so we're going to talk about the demonstrations in Europe and the us later in the program there have been very few demonstrations on Arab streets as we would have expected in the past time there have been a few what's going on there well there have been some I mean there was what in Jordan yesterday and yeah relatively small but also the countries which where you would have expected those demonstrations Syria Iraq and so on are not the countries that have power in the Middle East anymore the countries with power are the gulf countries Saudi Arabia UAE Qatar and nobody demonstrates on the streets there because you're not allowed to and also it's about money there isn't it and investment in Israel and all these other things absolutely and also people there are not politically engaged in the same way in the Gulf they' never been as politically engaged as they are in the Levant but it's those countries in the Gulf particularly the UAE Qatar and Saudi Arabia which will be the ones who decide what will happen in Gaza afterwards they are the ones with the money they are the ones with the political clout and they are the ones which have some kind of relationship with Israel so they are going to become ever more important Lindsay thank you very much indeed what joining me now is National Security expert and former Middle East advisor at the Pentagon Jasmine Al Gamal thank you so much for coming on the program Jasmine um do you think that diplomacy especially American diplomacy is working at the moment or is it failing uh unfortunately uh secretary blinkin has very little to show at this moment in time for the shuttle diplomacy that he's been conducting over the last four weeks as you mentioned protests around the world are getting louder and more urgent calling for a seiz fire for a humanitarian pause to let uh humanitarian assistance in uh secretary blinkin and President Biden's own party members are now asking urgently for a humanitarian pause you have around 60 members Democratic members of Congress both congressmen and women and Senators who have written to secretary blinkin to ask him for to push harder for a humanitarian pause uh and secretary blinkin himself has said that he's been having these conversations with the Israelis uh unfortunately to no avail at this point why do you think that is I mean it always puzzles me why the Americans who spend so much money and send so many weapons to Israel don't have more clout in these very perilous times you know I mean that's a great point it's a great question I mean one of the one of the sort of primary uh reasons that the US Administration successive U us administrations have stated uh that the reason they are so publicly supportive of Israel they call this bare hug diplomacy uh unequivocal unwavering support for Israel and public is precisely because they think that that should give them more leverage behind the scenes to push for things like a humanitarian pause that is so needed right now and you see that that's not happening I think it tells you something about what the Israeli government and what Israeli officials are feeling right now in terms of pressure to to come up with some sort of resol to that Minister Netanyahu can hold up to his people and say look I know I messed up on October 7th I know I was to blame I know you're angry but look here's what we've done um and I think that that is what's driving them to ignore American requests at at the moment and up until now I mean the question that we keep coming back to like a tongue to an aching tooth is what on Earth happens with Gaza after this is all over the day after and frankly I've not heard a single viable idea from anyone here in Jerusalem or Tel Aviv or London or Washington about what might happen do you have any clue um so this is the topic obviously of discussions uh around policy circles uh I've written about this in the last week uh trying to think about okay what happens the day after now the obviously what everybody agrees on right now what everybody's trying to tell the Israelis right now is a military solution does not exist to this conflict you have tried it time and time again you go in with all of your military might and you leave and this happens over and over again because you are not addressing the root cause of the problem which is the fact that Palestinians are not allowed to have their own state to live side by side in dignity and peace with the Israelis and unless you get to that point unless you get to the point where people are able to live in their own sovereign state unfortunately we are going to keep seeing this kind of violence again and again right and yet Anthony blinkin yesterday disinterred the two- State solution like the Dead Sea Scrolls you know hear something from from earlier from a distant era I mean is that is that even a a workable proposition these days I mean to be honest it becomes less workable by the day I mean when you have you know the number of Civilian casualties in Gaza right now the number of settlers that are sort of um agitating and um and and conducting violent attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank I mean the more this goes on the less viable a two-state solution is because what's left what's left for a Palestinian state where are the Palestinians that are going to be living in that state if over 9,000 of them have been killed in a month so these are the kinds of questions and these are the kinds of conversations that secretary blinkin President Biden should be having with the Israelis is to say what you're doing right now is ruining prospects for peace and this hurts you in the long term right okay jasine alal going to leave it there thank you very much indeed for coming on the program now the families of some of the 241 people still being held hostage in Gaza have been protesting in Tel and here in Jerusalem outside the Supreme Court demanding more action to bring their relatives home I've met with a number of families throughout this crisis including yonatan saen son of Peace activist Vivian Silva who spoke to us just a few days after the Hamas attacks 4 weeks later I sat down with him again Vivian Silva is one of Israel's most prominent peace campaigners uh I'm sitting in my backyard uh my home is uh 3 minutes from the Gaza Strip that proximity was indicative of her politics but also proved fateful on October the 7th when she was believed to have been taken hostage by Hamas waiting for news any news in his flat in Tel Aviv is her son yonatan I believe that if she would have um been rescued on the 7th she would have been very vocal about stopping the war and um and push for diplomacy even though many members of her community were slaughtered that day yeah because force of only brings more death um and you know dead babies in Gaza won't heal our dead babies the only way to move forward is with peace and uh the Notions we had up until now that's the proof that they were false if and when your mother comes back when she's free again there will be Israelis who say to her all your work all your good intentions were wasted what would you say on her behalf in response I would say they weren't wasted they were disregarded she had the right idea the fact that we're here is because not enough people listen from both sides you know I see the brutal attack on the seventh and the ability to to to use such viciousness in a context of um of so many years of both sides dehumanizing each other we as a society are able to keep on the occupation we're able to bomb Gaza like ants and the other side is able to you know Hamas was able to burn people alive to kill babies defile bodies so you know that's the escalation of dehumanizing when you accept the concept that it's acceptable in the world that another human being isn't worth his own life so it becomes a reality so in that hierarchy of evil doing where does one belong in the other I think good and evil in this case isn't uh between two sides it's between two Powers the power of life and the power of death and there both Powers uh exist in both sides so when Progressive people they have it wrong you know you have to condemn hamas's actions on the seventh and it doesn't mean you're not an ally to the Palestinian people thanks very much yanen speaking to me earlier that's all from Jerusalem for tonight back to Aisha in London Aisha thanks Matt now tens of thousands of pro Palestinian protesters have taken to the streets in London and other cities around the UK for the fourth week in a row Oxford Circus was brought to a standstill as part of the crowd staged a sit in earlier the UK's Chief Rabbi warned against the rise of hateful extremism and claimed the line was in danger of becoming blood between demon rators and those who support the brutal terrorism of Hamas Amilia Jen reports converging on London's trafala Square for the fourth weekend in a row but for the first since the Home Secretary labeled these protests hate marches from Paris to Sydney to Buenos Ares thousands gathered to protest Israel's bombing of Gaza in retaliation to hamas's October attack fire now fire now in Harrow a few hundred walked to their labor MP's office to call for him to support a full ceasefire instead of humanitarian pause to let Aid in they're not hate marches they're peaceful matches we're asking to stop bombing somewhere how can that possibly be hate we're not inciting any hate we're asking that somewhere be stopped bombing so that children can live completely divisive rhetoric it's it's wrong I mean look at look at the crowd there are plenty of children here I'm here with my child it's it's a peaceful protest um absolutely not hate marches at [Music] all this is a conflict felt very deeply the language around it so often disputed and divisive I think now more than ever the prec the Precision of language is absolutely crucial and although there has been plenty of hate expressed on these marches I think the characterization as a hate March that blanket term was not one that Jewish news has been using from The River To The Sea specifically I know that there are people who would question whether that actually means eradication of Israel but if you think about it from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea if that is Palestine then there is no room for the existence of Israel on one inch of that land today the chief Rabbi said that while a majority were protesting to support innocent civilians in Gaza a minority supported Hamas and that the lines were getting blurred he said it should be clear that what Hamas meant by resistance Jihad or inada was hateful extremism but that instead more and more were openly calling for them here and around the world our principles are very very clear we've been very very clear we call for full support for international law which makes clear that the targeting and killing of civilians that the taking of hostages and the imposition of collective punishment on entire populations are illegal yesterday the Prime Minister called plans to protest on Remembrance Sunday disrespectful saying it could risk the desecration of the Senate half organizers say they'd never planned to protest in the same location or even at the same time tonight as we go to air protesters staged to sit in at a station near trafala square with nearly 1,800 officers and Reserve deployed in London alone this is the most police demonstration yet the rhetoric getting more impassioned each day the conflict continues"}, "X1DkXAHtV_Y": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1DkXAHtV_Y", "video_id": "X1DkXAHtV_Y",

strikes Israel has fired artillery following that shabal Farms is situated along the border between Lebanon and Syria's Golden Heights which was occupied by Israel in 1967 Zur joins us now live from Southern Lebanon let's start with the location where hasah fired upon how significant is it that it chose the Shabah Farms rather than an area in the South along the border with Israel well yes hasbalah treading carefully trying to avoid a wider confrontation but sending a message to the Israelis that we are here we are ready uh to join the fight Shiba is a territory that is occupied by Israel seen by Lebanon as its own territory so Hezbollah saying that this is a legitimate fight but in its statement also saying that it is showing solidarity with the Palestinian people who are fighting the Israelis and a short while ago a high ranking Hezbollah official really made the group's position even clearer he said that we are not staying neutral in this conflict in his words today we sent a message through the attack that was carried out in Shiba and this Israel should understand this clearly and in its in his words Israel and the United States should stop this stupidity that was the word that they Ed Stop This stupidity or else the whole region will be involved in this war so basically saying that uh the equation that Hezbollah has established uh unifying the fronts of the different Lebanese armed groups as as well as Palestinian armed groups part of the so-called axis of resistance will come together and uh wage this this this war together so this is the message coming from Hezbollah at the moment there is a cautious calm along the border just behind me uh on top of that Hill is the Israeli position that was targeted in the early hours of the morning Zena what is the bottom line for many people who I'm sure have the question on their minds are we going to see a repeat of the 2006 W is this escalating in the south of Lebanon people are worried many Lebanese are worried because that was a devastating War more than a month in 2006 between Israel and Hezbollah and that's why Hezbollah knows that it has domestic political opponents uh and many people here will say this country cannot afford a war the state is nearly uh bankrupt and there is a dire economic crisis now in its fourth year and there's also a political crisis where there is no president there is no functioning government uh there is a need for billions of dollars to revive the economy and many people believe that Hezbollah should not act on its own it should respect the state sovereignty it should not be the one who decides whether this country is at war or peace and many accuse the group of being an arm of Iran and implementing Iran's policy the group does not hide away of or shy away from the fact that it is it is backed by Iran and it receives funding from Iran so this is definitely um hezbollah's involvement in this war will definitely uh divide the society even further and deepen uh the political crisis in the country all right thank you so much well Nimrod gorin is joining us now from West Jerusalem he's a senior fellow for Israeli Affairs at the Middle East Institute good to have you with us so first of all how much of a failure how politically compromising is this for the Israeli government the Israeli discussion is still dealing with the security rather than with the political because we are experiencing a security event that is unprecedented in Israel history very different than previous escalations or Cycles with Warfare with g at this time it was not an evolving crisis out of any Israeli action it was out of the blue targeting civilians large losses still ongoing many being captive so I think the Israeli Focus now is in how to solve the current security situation and deal with the politics later you say out of the blue but let me read to you here a statement by the Secretary General of Amnesty International dated October the 7th where from what she's saying it doesn't seem out of the blue she references the need for the Israeli government to refrain from inciting violence tension in the occupied West Bank she calls for the root causes of the violence to be addressed and goes on to list the 16y yearlong illegal blockade on Gaza and ending other aspects of quote Israel's system of apartheid opposed on all Palestinians do you think that this might shift Israeli thinking somewhere to start thinking about dealing with the root causes I think those are different things because you know we know the Israel Palestinian conflict is longlasting and it has different attitudes towards it in different approaches there are different reports mentioning different situation but reality is bad reality is bad for the Palestinians under occupation it's bad for Israelis who do not enjoy peace with their neighbors and this is ongoing and we saw lots of escalation along the way and lots of efforts to resolve the conflict which usually did not succeed when I mention out of the blue I referring to the immediate situation prior to yesterday attack if you recall previous Cycles in Gaza usually there were either assassinations or Rockets toward the nearby vill in Gaza it was something that went on we have it may not have been very reported in all parts of the press but we have been covering uh incidents of Israeli actions in the alaka mamos compound which the Palestinians and Palestinian factions even in Gaza are warning that this is very provocative we've seen a rise in settler attacks which we've covered extensively has this do you think this is not in the Israeli public opinion is not part of the story of why these people are breaking out of 16 years of Siege and going on this kind of attack into into Israel what I'm saying is that this incident has happened even before remember before Ramadan of this year there were T in AA there were several rounds of escalation with the PJ butan Islamic Jihad based on similar issues so the core issues of the conflict is definitely there the practicalities of how this conflict is handled have been managed differently until what happened yesterday so this is why what is happening is is different okay the reality is there and we do not nobody's denying it but what is happening is very different than before and the type of action has been taken yesterday against Israeli civilians is a scope that never happens so there is ways to do the Warfare I think what we saw yesterday it is a reminds that cres all of those lines and enters a new reality again without denying the difficult situation isra and Palestinians are living at during the last decad actually given the large number of Israeli casualties so far do you think that this government this Israeli government is going to be under intense pressure now to make not only the very intense and and bloody air strikes which have cost a lot of Palestinian civilian lives but a ground defensive as well do do you kind of feel like there's no way out now for this Israeli government other than going with a ground offensive into Gaza I think it's difficult to anticipate and it's not necessarily that one solution will be taken over the other we do not know I think currently the the goal is to prevent the fighting to continue within Israeli territory there are still incidents ongoing within the Israeli borders I think there is a strong will to take action against the military wing of Hamas there is a willingness to prevent further escalation into other areas you know we spoke before about Leon in your report these are things that Israel is not interested in so I think that's what we'll see in the coming future whatever tactics will be used to achieve that I think it's difficult for us to anticipate if Israel does launch a ground offensive where does it go to next it doesn't really link to the ground offensive because the political or the Strategic goal of such a cycle of violence should be the same whatever tactic is being operated yes what the Prime Minister said is about taking a price from the Hamas and losing having to lose its military capacity that doesn't mean that this goal could be achieved only by one mean of action or the other so I would say the tactic that is being used is unrelated to the overall goal and these two things can be discussed in parallel has it been a surp has the capabilities of Hamas come as a surprise launching an attack like this by land by air and so on on yes what happened was a surprise you know there were discussions in the past seeing this as a scenario that Kamas would like to see happening so I think the sense of surprise is about the actual implementation of this scenario the ability it was made possible and happened so it's not only the surprise from Kamas it's also the surprise of how Isel was expected to be able to deal with such a situation and prevent it and this didn't happen and it does relate also to political discussions within Israel that happened throughout the last month about where the focus of this government was and whether it was on the right issues that served the best Israel is interest all right thank you very much for your analysis on that appreciate your time nimrod goren"}, "S76XtQrsTM8": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S76XtQrsTM8", "video_id":

"transcript": "but of course we begin here with our big story Israeli Defense Forces striking a refugee camp there in Gaza and the IDF again claiming that it killed a Hamas leader in that strike that was involved in the deadly terror attack in Israel so joining us now is retired US Army Lieutenant General William Troy uh General thank you so much for your time we appreciate it and we we have some new reporting here uh from the IDF that is saying that not only did they kill a Hamas official in that strike but several terrorists as well and the IDF also saying that they're actually engaging in face-to-face combat uh in an area of this refugee camp so what does that mean about how deep these Ida forces have actually moved into Gaza at this point it's it sounds like they've moved uh quite deep into Gaza and what we're seeing now is the next phase of the operation where you're going to have this Urban combat moving from building to building and uh it's going to be tense uh it'll be high casualty producing most likely um and it's going to take time uh but I think that's the phase that we're we're watching right now yeah and Lieutenant General on the ground the IDF has released some new video that actually shows uh their quote expanded ground operation in Gaza and in this other piece of video that we have you can actually see uh bulldozers that are essentially clearing paths there are ground troops that appear to be taking up positions there's also uh ground troops patrolling in the dark so what do those videos indicate to you about Israel's approach it it sounds to me like they are preparing for followon forces they they want to have routes that are cleared and secured and by by that we mean they are free of minds they're free of enemy we can bring up uh more forces and they're going to soon need uh you know resupply casualty evacu uation they want to be able to do that on routes that are secure so I I think that's probably a large part of what's going on now you need dozers you need heavy equipment you need sappers who are Engineers who can clear obstacles and then once they get those obstacles cleared they get those routes cleared they've got to keep them cleared so that means that they've got to have forces that will remain on those routes keep them clear so they can bring up the fine forces more combat forces and then more Port they're going to they're going to need more ammunition more food more fuel and then they're going to need to get casualties back to the rear so I think that's what they're preparing now right and we were you were actually able to see some of these reinforced dozers there as you were talking about that Lieutenant General also uh we have other new video that was released by The F IDF and Hamas and our team has reviewed these videos and in them you also see these armored armored vehicles that are at the border of Israel and Gaza and they're near the Sea and the vehicles are seen sort of digging in on the beach and working their way into Gaza so what does that tell you about the idf's attempts to gain access into Gaza by the water I I think they want multiple axes uh into the area um by having multiple axes you really prevent uh the enemy from concentrating all their resources in one place they've got to defend several places um and they they are limited just like any military force and how many places they can go what forces they can apply so they're they're presenting uh multiple problems to their enemy which is what you want to do in an attack like this so that you can move as as fast as you can as safely as you can and also in the air of course you know the IDF says that they've activated this new aerom missile defense system for the first time to intercept a missile launch from the Red Sea to Israel iaf Jets also intercepted as they said here hostile Targets in the Red Sea and they're saying that they've struck now over 300 Targets in Gaza so how long can Israel sustain this well uh I I think the the aerial part of this campaign and as you know you fight a war through a series of campaigns and uh we've seen uh the intelligence campaign is ongoing the air campaign is ongoing but I think soon you'll see that the air campaign is going to recede somewhat and then allow the ground campaign to go forward because there's always uh the risk of fraer side uh they don't want that so they will start using other means of uh fire support maybe uh gunship helicopters or Tactical Air Support they can use artillery um so that as you get closer to the enemy and distances start to close down perhaps some of that air Campaign Will recede and then other forms of air supp support uh will start to take the for we'll be watching for that and there are we're hearing now that the houthis have taken responsibility for the attacks near the Red Sea Tuesday and separately the Pentagon press secretary says that there's now been 27 attacks on US forces in Iraq and Syria by these iran-backed militants since October 17th uh is this a concern given that us officials are having constant anxiety about a wider regional conflict specifically with these Iran backed entities one thing I think secretary Austin has done and the president has done through his own channels is to make very clear um to Iran and to any other actors out there uh don't widen this conflict and we've got the forces in place uh number one to defend our forces and I think Admiral Kirby uh was very clear about that the other day we are going to defend our forces um and and that is utmost uh and we are trying trying to be very clear with other actors in the area don't take advantage of the situation don't try to uh widen this conflict uh because we will be well prepared for that eventuality well prepared Lieutenant General William Troy thank you so much for your expertise and your time today we really appreciate it I want to now bring our big story to our panel so joining us today is our ABC News contributor and SiriusXM radio host Mike Muse along with ABC News contributor and former Republican congresswoman from Virginia Barbara comto former US Senate candidate and president of gen America Christina csen Ramirez and ABC News contributor and former Navy SEAL Commander Eric ol thank you so much for joining us we really appreciate it and first uh Commander to you as you just listened to that conversation we had there about uh the concern that this conflict could expand the concerns about Iran being involved and I will also share with you um some of the uh some words from uh defense secretary Lloyd Austin that indicated today at various points the US will strike back if the attacks on our us bases persist so what's your take no uh thank you Kan on the 26th of October um we did two strikes on basically Iranian munition facilities and that was one self-defense and two is also to act as a deterrent but since then as the secretary highlighted today US forces have been attacked 27 times in the last two weeks I think we need to start hitting targets that are a little bit more higher priority and make it a bit more painful for the Iranians to continue with this activity um just as is right now our deterrence is not working interesting and Barbara as we go to you here we know there's you know funding concerns uh for Israel but there's also funding concerns for Ukraine as well uh defense secretary lyd Austin also said today I can guarantee you that without our support Putin will be successful but this proposal from Republicans doesn't have any aid for Ukraine in it so is it time that they bundle that together or what's the next step there for Republicans to get Aid to Israel does that have to include Ukraine um I I think it definitely does and I think the Senate has uh been very good uh you know on a bipartisan basis uh tying them together and also putting in border security here in the United States something that House Republicans have always been very concerned with so while I know uh the house proposal that was put forward today only had Israel funding and with that was tying it to a pay for that will never get through the Senate and never get approved they really do need to get serious when you see these kind of situations today the things on the ground this needs to be put together and move forward quickly and Christina to you uh the FBI director saying that this war in the Middle East has raised the Spectre that Americans could be targeted in the US we've already seen these hate crimes as you know the six-year-old boy killed uh there's been hate fuel speech on college campuses how is the younger generation perceiving these threats we've seen a lot of division and also a lot of unity at the same time of people coming out and calling and seeing what happened you know just several weeks ago we saw 1,400 Israeli civilians women children violently murdered show no humanity and now few weeks later 21,000 Palestinians injured 8,500 dead thousands of them are children and we just saw some of the largest protest we've seen across the country um and Civil Disobedience including in New York by uh Jewish voice for peace calling for a ceasefire I think we are seeing a tremendous Unity at the same time between Jewish and Palestinian communities that want to see an end to the violence um but there is great Division and I think language really matters here that people have to really honor lives on both sides and when we don't do that we foment division um and violence and so I think that that's really really critical and we need to be doing a lot more of that right and of course the White House is saying you know that the numbers that are coming out of the Palestinian Health Ministry that is run by Hamas they say you know those numbers may not add up and the White House is doing all they can to understand more about the numbers of the Dead in Gaza but without question there has been tremendous civilian casualties there and Mike as we go to you you know earlier today we heard from New York Governor Kathy hok that there's actually a person of interest now in custody in connection to anti-semitic violence and a mass shooting threat at the campus at Cornell uh the FBI putting out a statement they're aware of these threats they're working with local authorities but Mike do you have an opinion here on what more could be done yeah I think what's going to be interesting is in the conversations with the FBI and the FBI director and listening uh to press secretary Kine John Pierre yesterday uh really talk about how the Department of Justice is going to be looking at uh to raise these Lev level of instabilities that is happening um on College University campuses possibly to a level of a hate crime um and really taking it seriously I think that once the Department of Justice begins to lend its voice to determine how they will begin to investigate and or prosecute uh these hate crimes on campus and how they will attach possibly oh let me edit that how they will investigate possible assaults or intimidation or harassment on campus and then if they will escalate that to a hate crime I think then you will start to see measured uh temperament when it comes to people exercising Free Speech just as long as it doesn't create undue harm to others right and again you know we spoke with someone from the Anti-Defamation League today and they said that you know instances of anti-Semitic rhetoric or threats are up 400% since this attack on Israel and that 15% of those are happening on college campuses so certainly something to continue to unpack here thank you so much Mike Barbara Christina and Eric we appreciate your time hi everyone George Stephan here thanks for checking out the ABC News YouTube

2021 the Court ruled that territories occupied by Israel since 1967 including Gaza and the West Bank were within its jurisdiction the IC C has had ongoing investigations in the occupied territories for possible crimes against humanity and war crimes since then several countries have voiced their condemnation of Hamas attack over the weekend Israel however has called out one superpower in particular T Aviv expressing deep disappointment with the announcements and statements Beijing has made on the conflict China has so far called for international cooperation to prevent a spillover of violence for Japan there's no justification for the conduct shown by Hamas Tokyo says Israel has the right to defend itself and its people under international law the Israeli ambassador to Japan had clarified that they were at war with Hamas and not the people of Gaza at the same time he cautioned Tokyo against providing Aid to Palestinians the Palestinian permanent missions Envoy to Japan on the other hand says humanitarian Aid should continue and other parties should play a neutral role in the conflict he also calls out the West for its support for Israel this violence has to stop on both sides we condemn unequivocally the violence on both sides on the Palestinian side and on the Israeli side and we condemn also Israel and it allies on The Narrative of war and destruction of the Palestinian population in Gaza we are not seeing the residents of Gaza Strip as our enemies Hamas is our enemy Hamas is our enemy and we'll pay the price of what he did to us protests are still erupting in support of either Israel or the Palestinians up to 1,000 Malaysians have gathered in the capital of qualo on Frid after Friday prayers to show solidarity with the Palestinians carrying flags and placards two former Prime Ministers muhidin Yasin and mahat Muhammad were [Music] present Hungary meanwhile has banned rallies supporting quote terrorist organizations Budapest has condemned the attacks by Hamas and supported Israel's right to defend itself after for more we're joined Now by John Lyon he's executive director at Alliance for Middle East peace he joins us live now from Paris Mr Lyndon Israel is telling everyone in North Gaza that's about 1.1 million people to relocate to the to the south of the strip in the next 24 hours there are about 9 hours left to that deadline the Israeli government the military would arguably have calculated the improbability of that happening why ask the impossible it's an excellent question uh it is practically impossible and I've seen this dilemma playing out today with a friends of mine and their families in the Gaza Strip where people are trying to scram to move essentially half the population of the Gaza Strip to the other half the southern half of the territory um some of them have said there's no point they're staying at home they're barricading themselves in and hoping for the best others are now arranging to stay with absolute strangers down close to the Egyptian Border in the hope that will allow them to escape uh the worst of the the Carnage that does seem to be coming following a ground Invasion that most expect in the coming hours and days um and again you know we've heard calls from from uh International agencies from the United Nations for Israel to really reconsider this and to try and um approach alternate ideas that may sort of still allow Israel to do what it seems fairly dedicated to doing at the moment which is removing Hamas as the governing Authority inside the Gaza Strip and it's important to not the biggest Hospital in Gaza is in the north of Gaza it is at the moment overrun there between I think four and 6,000 injured people there who can't be treated who are running out of electricity for that hospital you can't move severely injured people uh to the other side of the Gaza Strip without putting their lives in very serious Jeopardy so we really would urge um throughout this crisis the prioritization of civilian life uh what happened on Saturday was an abject and disgraceful example of uh an attack on civilian life the worst terrorist attack we' have seen in the history of the Israeli Palestinian conflict but we must not allow that now to um uh to to to allow further civilian uh lives to be lost and and huge Fallout for people's family and for many many people I'm speaking to who are very scared at the moment Mr Lyndon there are many who've chosen to stay we have seen images of people who are leaving many families headed south uh to waza towards the Rafa border talk to us about the sheer vulnerability and Logistics of actually trying to move these people under these circumstances I mean it's a very small territory and we talking about half the population so you don't even need to be an expert on the topography or the demographics of Gaza to understand how difficult that is um there is a lack of fuel and Diesel uh to be able to actually drive roads an important sort of and there's there's very few radial roads that will also connect north to south many of them have been destroyed and damaged in the air strikes taking place over the last six days um and also when you try and move half a population with a 24hour deadline when everybody understands at the end of that deadline an intense am of violence is going to commence you create a sense of panic as people will be taking extraordinary steps to try and save themselves and their families I expect there to be accidents things that will happen in the progress of this huge population move that will result in yet more unnecessary loss of life and injury to Palestinians and it's not even clear at the end of that process whether the people who are in southern Gaza will ultimately be safe if there is an invasion and we must remember as well that Hamas are reading the same warnings that the civilian population they hide within our reading and I would imagine they are probably moving infrastructure and Personnel to the South as well so literally nobody it will be safe in Gaza with some of the violence that uh that is to be expected in the coming days there's certainly no guarantee of safety if they reach the South uh and if they reach the Rafa border as an example we know that the Egyptian authorities have closed their side of the border crossing just who controls the Palestinian side of that Crossing is unclear do we know do we have Clarity on that and can Egypt realistically be even part of a successful evacuation here I mean Egypt's role here is crucial I know that the United Nations special coordinator Tor wesland was in Cairo yesterday may still be there meeting with the Egyptian foreign minister uh I'm certain that secretary blinkin is having discussions with him whilst he is in the region I know he's in Jordan today um It's Complicated on on on the Egyptian side and that they have opened and closed Rafa sort of repeatedly closed more often than not in the years since president CCE has uh has H come to power in in Egypt and there is also another Factor here which isn't being reported on quite as much in that 70% of the population of the Gaza Strip are themselves refugees or their descendants from the war in 1948 and there is real concern sincere concern amongst many Palestinians I speak to that if they leave Gaza which you know from a life and limb perspective would be the smart to do now if Rafa opens they worry whether they'll ever be allowed to return again now we can argue about whether or not that fear is Justified but it is certainly sincerely felt by very many Palestinians with the memory of of of of refugee crisis in the past and of course Egypt is thinking the same thing and that they um don't want to suddenly be responsible for hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees who are permanently ins sconed in uh in the Sin Peninsula and nobody is really saying that publicly but I'm pretty sure that is part of the calculation that going on right now which is why I think at minimum at this moment a humanitarian Corridor needs to be created right now for basic Goods to get into Gaza because that really has not been happening since Saturday morning and then obviously to facilitate exit if that is possible with the guarantee that Palestinians will be able to return to their homes after these hostilities end which which cannot come soon enough I want to thank you for your insights there Mr Lyndon John Lyndon their executive director at Alliance for Middle East peace"}, "weKayS00Onk":

yesterday in Jordan uh you made some very strong comments about Israel committing war crimes a very serious accusation what has driven you to make that well I mean I mean first of all uh these are uh statements of fact uh we're watching with with tremendous uh uh shock uh what Israel is bringing about on on on gazin um over 9,000 people killed over 4,000 uh children among them women elderly uh over 150,000 houses demolished hospitals diminished to lowest capacity uh that they cannot treat the wed anymore and these are by international law War crime and I think all of us who uh want an end of of violence and War uh in this part of the world and we do want that for everybody for Palestinians and for the Israelis have to call things as they are and and I think what we're trying to do is to get everybody to understand that this madness cannot continue and that this war has to stop because nobody is benefiting on the contrary everybody is losing Palestinians are losing their lives uh people around the region are losing faith in in in the possibility of viable peace and Israel is losing uh its Humanity in in in this war so hence are the very direct and and very factual statement that I made now Jordan has joined other Arab uh Nations calling for a ceasefire this is something that the US government and the UK government have not backed they're calling for a pause why is a ceasefire so important and what would you say to your American and British counterparts well I mean the ceasefire is important because it will stop uh the the the the killing of innocent it will stop destroying uh Gaza it will stop the illegal inhumane displacement of over 1.4 million people so I think the logic for ceasefire uh speaks for itself as for uh our our partners in the US and and the UK on this we disagree uh our argument is that if you want to help Israel by all means help but you're not helping Israel by uh uh not speaking against this this m war that it is launching if you want to help Israel help it make peace because peace is the only path to guaranteeing the security of Palestinians and Israelis so instead of uh sending uh support and arms to Israel send delegations to have them have the Israelis sit on the table and negotiate a piece that will be the best self-defense for everybody in the region for the Palestinians and for the Israelis and the two-state solution which have we've been advocating for for decades is the only way to get that so uh we're simply again again saying what human logic says Stop The Killing of the innocent and we're saying uh a ceasefire is a must uh because with every minute that goes without a ceasefire I think your own pictures and images played on your TV uh show the human cost that's that's being paid yes you also talked about the importance of a two-state solution uh in at that Summit yesterday would Jordan be willing to play a role in brokering peace uh we've always been uh playing a role in in in in broken peace where for decades his majesty and and his late Majesty before him uh have been working for peace uh we have engaged everybody we dedicated efforts and we told everybody Israelis and others that the only way for all our peoples to to enjoy security and have freedom and live like any other people anywhere on Earth we need to have peace the problem is we're dealing with an Israeli government uh who has shown no interest in that uh uh actually you know statements from the current Israeli government uh saying very openly that Palestinians should not aspire to have a state that they thought that they could parachute over the Palestinian issue and and deal with it as an issue of just getting a job here and there and create Regional peace and and I think this war sadly and tragically has proven the illogical uh the illogic of this of this absurdity of this of this argument and look I mean today a sitting is isi government a member of the Israeli cabinet calls publicly for ning Gaza what he's simply saying is that WIP Gaza out of out of you know from the face of this earth kill 2.4 million people it's not for him enough for him that Israel has already thrown what's equivalent to one and a half time the Firepower thrown in Hiroshima on Gaza that's not enough for him and this again this is reflective of the extremist racist uh radical elements that are in the driver's seat of Israeli decision making and that should explain why uh people have lost faith in peace and why we continue to to be in conditions that is that is just conducive to more violence and and more war now Jordan has been an ally of Israel for decades now but you're also very consistent in your criticism of what's happening in Gaza at the moment how are relations between Jordan and Israel are they reaching a new low well I mean let me just say we're not an ally of Israel we're a country that made peace with Israel in 1994 within the context of moving towards comprehensive peace that will address the Palestinian issue as the core source of conflict in the region and that would lead to the regional comprehensive peace that's the right of every uh people in the region Palestinian Israelis and everybody else uh we have used that peace agreement and we have used those channels we have with the Israeli government to continue to impress upon them the need to stop measures that are uh uh uh making uh it impossible to realize the two-state solution measures that undermine the two-state solution building more settlements uh confiscating Palestinian land suffocating the economy of the Palestinian people actually occupying the economy of Palestine because the West Bank is a captive market for Israel if you look at the numbers uh uh uh so and consolidating occupation so we've been engaging with them directly and working with all our friends and partners including in the US in the UK in Europe and our uh uh Arab countries in the region to work towards for peace unfortunately uh there's been a failure the whole International Community failed in solving what we all know is the core conflict of the region what we all knew would would be a a powder Kake wearing to explode and sadly and tragically we see what's happening now the conditions on which the October attack happened and again we all uh uh project uh the pain that was imposed in Israelis as much as we ask the Israelis and the rest of the International Community to also speak a pain and and and Agony being brought on Palestinians but this war will only create conditions that will be conducive uh to an environment to be a wasteland to be honest where no hope will grow no no no peace will grow it will be a wasteland of death and destruction and despair and what what can that get all of us so our message is direct and simple stop this war Stop The Killing of the innocent this war is not selfdefense uh the best self-defense for Israel and everybody else is to stop this madness set around the table and work for peace and I I may like his majesty King Abdullah said for we all should work for a a reality where you have peace and two states between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean do you think the International Community the US the UK uh European nations the United Nations have done enough to mediate here or do they not have enough influence if not who does I I'm not sure if I got your question right but I think you asked if the UN and the UK have done enough so I'm I'm going to answer that in the International Community in the International Community do the US the UK does does any party have enough influence to facilitate DS escalation here I I think we all have roles to play the UK is a is a country that has a very strong relations in the region including with Jordan and everybody else so I think it can play a major role the US has a leading role to play the rest of European countries all of us uh can can come together uh the obviously I mean uh the International Community as a whole the security Council almost almost 21 days into this catastrophe has not been able to come with one resolution urging a ceasefire urging a humanitarian POS urging a stop of the killing and standing uh on the side of international law which considers denying people food and Medicine a war crime which considers Collective punishment a war crime so not much has done and and let me be very honest and and straight for you it is no longer acceptable to hide the failure of the International Community to do what it needs to do to stop the war by calling for humanitarian supplies you know what we on the Arab world we can provide all the humanitarian supplies that Gaza want we and Jordan are willing to share every we have to to to provide the humanitarian supplies that they need what the world needs to do is take a political stand a moral stand consistent with with international law consistent with human value consistent with the belief that every life matter no matter whether it's Palestinian or Israeli or any other nationality and act and act immediately and effectively to uh uh push for an immediate end of a war that will only make things worse for generations to come I've been saying uh this war the amount of hatred that it's producing is beyond imagination this hatred this anger this dehumanization will Define generations to come that is not in Israel's interest that's not in in anybody's interest and this is our message uh the damage this war is causing beyond the the the the the Epic catastrophe it's causing in terms of destroying Palestinian lives is is dangerous for years to come now Mr Safar I know it's hard to uh imagine right now but once this war is over would Jordan be willing to play some sort of governance role in Gaza look I I think we made it clear yesterday we will not accept not just Jordan all of us in the Arab world we will not accept a Gaza alone approach uh first of all we don't know what Gaza is going to look like after Israel done uh destroying it again Israel has not told anybody what victory means when will it have enough how many Palestinian lives it has to kill for for this war to end but after that we don't know what Gaza is going to look like but even Beyond Gaza alone is unacceptable what needs to be done is a comprehensive peace plan that addresses both the situation in Gaza the West Bank and it should be based on and geared towards a comprehensive solution that will result in the establishment of a viable Southern uh Palestinian State on Palestinian land junee 4 196 lines with occupied Jerusalem as capital living side by side Israel in peace and Harmony uh you know just localizing Gaza and and trying to deal with it from a security perspective will not work we will have no part to do with it uh we have told everybody that the answer has to be a big move by us who want peace to solve this once and for all and make sure nobody nobody in the region no Palestinian no Israeli will have to live uh uh through the horrors that that this latest round of vicious violence and War have have have have done Mr safadi we hear you loud and clear and we really appreciate your time this

So  first off,  can you  explain how you found out  that  your  wife  and  children  had have been Well,  then my wife  was visiting.  her mother. at  the  neuro ski boots and I wasn't   there.  with  them. and later  on  during  the phone  conversation. with, she  conversation with,  that  she  heard gunshots  and possible.  possibly  Hamas People   may be  entered to  to  the  kibbutz and we got   disconnected. and later on.  unfortunately.  from  video  that went viral.  later.   I saw that  she and my  two  young daughters araz   five years old and die.  Victory rolls.  got  kidnapped.  And then  I knew   for sure  that  when I   recognized them on  the video  that  that  was it. they got   taken.  It's  been. several  days  now.  there's  been some questions about  communication between the  families  of  people  who  were  taken hostage and the  government  have  they  been   in  touch with  you at all   to  give  you?  any kind  of   update. Well  yeah. we   didn't  contact and  the trying  to  give  me   information.  and  it's currently  I can say  that  I know. anything  But  you know, how I am.  I'm barely  barely.  I don't think I can get  information.  you know?  I'm in a bit  difficult  mental situation.  I'm exhausted.  I hadn't   said I haven't  had any sleep  in  the last. any days.  There are people  here   trying  to  help  me   to receive  this   information?  since my   family. didn't  come  home   and got abducted. I am.  you know  I'm devastated.  I'm barely  get, I  barely   can process information.  and  trying  to  raise the  awareness.  I only  want   people  to  look  at  the  photos. just  tell  the world  help  me  girl. Someone do   something.  I need  my   family. eats  something  will something happen.   To them or  something will   happen  to  them, Because I  really  don't know. what   happened  to  them. I will   not be  able  to. live  in.  And I saw that you  did have   some  photos  over  there as   well, I know  we've talked   about your  wife  and your   two children  who are missing  you were  holding up  a photo  a bit earlier,  I know  that   you're  trying  to  get the  word  out,  you are on   social  media.  You're   talking to  as many people   you as  you know, you can  at this point.  your   ultimate  goal  of  course,  is  to  make  sure  that   they  are found in  that   they  are found safe, But  you know  there are so  many   questions here  about the  whole situation.  in general.  We  also  know that a lot of   people  have  said  there is   violence in the middle.  Released  this  happens.  We   hear about  it  frequently   but what  I want to make sure  to  capture is  that  this   is  something so  completely.  different than  than  we've  seen  before. right?  I think  that. everyone  knows that.  think that  everyone  knows  that  there is  something  unusual if  you'd like   even for  this   region but you know I'm  I'm not a military man,  but the security   of diplomatic public   diplomacy,  man.  It's  not  my  training. I'm trying   to understand from  from   what  I know, but I  know that, but we are  in some kind of way.   War that. needs to get. taken  over  And also, finish  it,  you know, we  need  to   finish  the war and stop the   war and but right now  the only  thing I can think  about this  the photos   that you  are showing right  now,  of  me  of  my   two daughters of  my  wives.   I don't understand  what   don't is  the connection  of   those?  three?  girls?  That   that are  all my  life? What?  What  is  the connection  of   them  to  debt to this? There  they're babies.

efforts on Hamas we didn't start this we didn't want it but we are definitely going to end it and it will end with a totally dismantled Hamas in a totally different security situation in the south we are on the 25th day of the fighting of the war I am lieutenant colonel in the reserve Jonathan and I want to give you a daily update a few topics we're going to have a small piece of good news about the release of an Israeli hostage who is now safe with her family we'll be speaking about the current situation on the ground in Northern Gaza we'll speak about tunnels and specifically comp compounds under hospitals that Hamas has prepared in Gaza and then we will go north and speak about Whata is doing how we are defending ourselves and what this means for the region stay with us let's begin with some positive news doesn't happen a lot that we have positive news but I am happy to say that private Ori mides is now back home with her family she was rescued in a special operation done by Israeli Security Forces IDF and Isa shabbach who went into Gaza got her out based on intelligence and on a lot of resources that were allocated towards this she is now home with her family she is well both mentally and physically she has provided intelligence that we'll be able to use in the future for future operations and the only thing that I can say that won't jeopardize operational security is that we are committed and determined to get all of the 238 Israeli hostages that are still inside Gaza let's speak about the southern command and the situation on the ground the commanders that you can see this is the General in command of the Southern command General yagon sorry Felman and he is leading the troops from the front that is how Israeli commanders lead some of these pictures were taken some of the footage was taken from inside Gaza our troops are now on the ground we are expanding our activity in G we've conducted a few raids over the last days we've expanded those now and Israeli troops are in various parts of U of Northern Gaza operating we have entered and as you can see here on this clip which is from a few days um heavily armored vehicles tanks apcs bulldozers entering into the Gaza Strip moving slowly meticulously with a lot of Firepower to support with with lots of intelligence and looking for Hamas and engaging with Hamas combatants attacking them on the ground and also from the air using many of the resources that we have available for us some other visuals that you can see tanks and apcs equipped equipped with special engineering construction to face the threats that we know that they're going to face inside the densely populated Urban Terrain and the columns that are advancing um and the various uh developments that we see that we see inside the situation on the ground is that we continue to strike Hamas we are striking in all parts of the Gaza Strip we have said before that we will continue to strike we will focus our activities on the northern part of Gaza that is the center of gravity of Hamas and that is where we are attacking now but we are also we continue to strike in other parts of Gaza we are hunting their Commanders we are attacking their infrastructure and whenever there is an important Target that is related to Hamas we strike it now we do so with professionalism Hamas is the enemy not the civilian population and we focus our military efforts on Hamas to make sure that civilians or to minimize the risk for civilians two weeks ago we called for the evacuation of civilians towards the South we have added to that a humanitarian Zone in the northern part of the Gaza Strip just northest west of kanun here called masasi and we hope that civilians will go there happy to see that more than 800,000 Palestinians have evacuated from the northern part from the main combat area where there's most of fighting Hamas has stopped many of them from doing so but many have and hopefully all of them will evacuate for a concern for their own safety and humanitarian assistance continues to be delivered through the RAF Corridor into Gaza into the southern Point there's also also more access to water there is food and as days go by I think we will be ramping up our the facilitation of humanitarian assistance to the Gaza Strip we do understand that the situation there is difficult but this is not of our doing and it isn't what we wanted please remember we are 25 in 25 days into the fighting we didn't start this we didn't want it but we are definitely going to end it and it will end with a totally dismantled Hamas in a totally different security situation in the South Let's uh speak about the shifa hospital for those of you who haven't seen this H this is an aerial view of shifa the most important and the largest hospital in Gaza Hamas is using this infrastructure like many other protected facilities in Gaza hospitals clinics schools mosques un facilities and we have shown footage of Rocket fire between mosques and un schools and we have shown how Hamas uses the proximity of civilians this perhaps is the most cynic and the worst use that they have done of these protected assets this is an illustration 3D of what's below above ground and below ground storage of weapons command and control facilities offices and places for terrorists to hide this is all underneath the hospital this is a violation of international law this is despicable and it puts the people that are being treated in the hospital at risk it should be condemned and it should be stopped before it's too late and that's the situation in Gaza operations continue we continue to strike from the air and our troops are on the ground enhancing the activities that we are conducting let's quickly move to the north and speak about what balah is attempting to do and how we are defending ourselves against balah up in the northala has been attacking across the border about now up until now they have fired Rockets they have tried to infiltrate they have fired dozens of anti-tank missiles at our civilians and at our military position they have fired rockets at our positions in Mount Dove and they have fired at our communities many things have been done byala we are defending ourselves again against this aggression we have been targeting and this this year these are the two senior commanders of of course Lieutenant General halvi our chief of staff and the general in charge of the northern command Major General Gordon they are on the ground monitoring the troops and making sure that the troops have the proper guidance and I want to show you some results of what our troops have been doing in retaliation tobah attacks these are strikes done and you can see maybe a bit graphic image here but I think this is part of what we're doing H strike conducted by our Commando units that are using precise intelligence and precise delivery of weapons against operatives up until nowah has quite a lot of casualties unfortunately we have casualties as well but at the end of the day what's important here is for the state of Lebanon to understand that they stand to lose almost everything and gain absolutely nothing by allowing to drag them into a war and if anybody cares about the state of Lebanon they should be out of this war because they will gain nothing from helping a bunch of terrorists in Gaza that is the situation we continue to be deployed strong and Vigilant along our borders H we are definitely not going to allowah to escalate and enhance their attacks against us we're defending against that and we will continue to operate in Gaza and defend ourselves on all of our other fronts rockets that were fired from Syria and all kinds of reports of aerial threats that we had in the south in [Music] aat"}, "i2Ev7fSSIKA": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2Ev7fSSIKA", "video_id": "i2Ev7fSSIKA", "description": "The death toll is in the hundreds and thousands more are

joining us  here  at the  top  of  the hour at No.1 on the  East Coast, we  are  continuing to monitor a  developing  story.  over  in   Israel  and the Gaza  Strip  as  Hamas launched   an attack.  overnight.   night. And in the early  morning hours infiltrating   parts of  Israel  and sending  thousands.  and hundreds  and  thousands of  rockets over.  into  Israel  killing Now at   least 100 people  There were   also  learning  some  200  of all  Also  been  killed   in a  dramatic, escalation   between tensions  between  these two groups. both   Hamas.  and the nation  of   Israel. I want  to  turn   right now to  Jonathan  Panic  off over  at  the Atlantic   Council.  to  break down.  Really  the very  latest  on   what's  Happening Here.  Thanks  so much for joining  us. Jonathan   thanks for having me.  Well, first off,  can you  just  kind of give  us  a  breakdown of  what's   Happening Here? and while  clashes between Hamas and  Israel  aren't new? this   escalation  appears to  be   you've seen Hamas  quite literally go  by  land   and go  through what   was thought to be a fairly   secure. border  fence.   You've seen them  go  by   sea.  what? literally using  small boats and  you've seen them  use  paragliders to  you've  into   Israel  by  are this  was a  coordinated.  very  well   very  well  executed. far  attack. by  Hamas.   terrorists, My senses were   at  the beginning of  this   episode now,  this  is   something new,  I think is   really  believe this  is   something new.  and we're  probably, just  starting  in   terms of  what  is going   to be a, you  would imagine  an  extended  conflict   absolutely, and we  are  taking  a live  look  over   in the  Gaza  Strip right  now.  These are some of the  new images  that  are coming   in  as  Israel  launched   that  essentially a  counter-attack  on  Hamas  militants there.  obviously  the death toll  in  Palestine  much  higher  than  what   we're seeing  right now in   Israel, Israel  has a bit  more  fortifications  to  my   understanding.  I'm hoping   you can kind of explain that.  for an audience especially   those who aren't  as  well   versed  in  the happenings of  the Middle  East, of  course,  so  look, Israel  is  more   fortified most  prominently  through the Iron Dome system   which is  an  air defense.   system. basically Hamas fires  rockets at  Israel  fires,   interceptors. they  Collide  in  midair  and so  the  Rockets don't hit Israel.  don't hit the ground  now.   we've seen  unusually some   of  them  actually  get  through.  We  don't know  the  numbers yet,  it's still   too early.  I think the  numbers is probably low.  but  because Hamas is  sending so,  So  many  Rockets is.  overwhelming  the system. at   times,  but that system has  provided  a level that   defense that  obviously those  living in Gaza. don't have   and so  it's  not unusual  to see  the number  of   deaths  in  Gaza. Be  quite a  bit higher  than  those in   Israel. The other thing worth  noting  though, however,  is   that  there is  a history and  I have  nothing to  confirm  that  has happened. This   moment, there is a  history.   of Hamas  using public   facilities  schools.  and  other public. venues. Use to   Hydra Rockets to  hide   missiles. And if  the  Israelis  are going to  be   targeting them, then  of   course, at the same time  you  also  see an increase in  the  number  of  deaths. from   such  facilities. Jonathan   we  did hear from Israel's   prime minister. Benjamin   Netanyahu just  moments ago.   I know. Netanyahu did play   that  out just a little bit  ago.  I just  want to play   that  out again for any of   our audience, just  joining  us. So  let's listen   into that. And then we can   react to that at on the back   end.  the enemy will  pay an   unprecedented price.  in the   meantime  I call  on  the  citizens  of  Israel  to   strictly  adhere  to  the  directives of the IDF and  Home  Front command.  We are   at  War.  and we  will  win  it. Now,  Jonathan  Israel's   prime minister. there  Benjamin  Netanyahu saying   quote, we are at  War Is   that  statement more?  escalated than  any other  statements  that  he's  made?  before  when  discussing   this? relationship  between  both  Hamas and Israel?  what's happening on the ground and what  do  you make of  those comments? yeah, there  is  a history and a period,  you know, period, you  obviously a long  campaign   in  2014. where you saw an   extended  conflict  with   come  bosses  well. but I  think over the  last  few  years you have  seen   Netanyahu during the  time   he's  been  prime minister.  Usually tried to  take   a slightly  more   moderate approach,  I think  what  it  is  is  a  reflection  that  he  and the  security  establishment in   Israel  recognize this  is   something new This  is  not  just  Rockets being fired  in a  tit-for-tat from  Hamas  To  Israel  and Israel   responding in kind. and the  type of,  broad.  multi.   multi-front attack  that   you're seeing.  an   infiltration  that  you're   seeing, puts  it  in a  new  category. And so  Israel  is   going to  respond as  it's  a  new and dynamic.  situation  that I   hasn't seen before. And so   that's  one of the  reasons I  of the reasons  there to be.   a fairly  intense.  and Broad  conflict  that  we  haven't  really  seen.  Let's say for the last  few  years.  we  continue  to take  a look  at  live  images   there on  the ground. I can't  tell  if  I'm not sure  if   this  is  the Gaza  Strip  tour in parts of  Israel. I'm  assuming  based on  that.  Palestinian flag  There That   is  the Gaza  Strip.  You can  see the burning of  tires.   also. in this same  shot,  let's go  ahead and pop up   the audio will  listen   to this for a second  here.  Jonathan. We  could  be earlier. explosion.   your bottles being thrown  around. in  gunshots.  off in the distance.  is   ambulances.  will just kind of simmer this for one secondhere.  all right,  pretty  dramatic   scenes  there as we take   another live  look  over  at   the Gaza Strip. You can see  the smoke in the distance  Rockets.  continuing  to go.   seemingly from  the Israel   side  over  to  Palestine.   again.  Most of these attacks  often tend to be  kind  of   heavy handed  from  the  Israelis. we  should  say is   that  something that  we're  going to  expect? in the   long  term?  and I'm talking about,  not  just  today,  but do   you think that  Israel is  going to  continue  a kind   of  an onslaught  of  an   attack  of  rockets onto the   Palestinians  or  what   is the  expectation of  what   is  to  happen  next?  So I think   you will certainly see. the  fairly robust is  really  I  think the question  of  think  actually  has less to do   with  Famas than it does.  another militant  act there  and terrorists after   which is  Hezbollah.  right  now.  Hezbollah has been  out  of  the state out of  this   conflict   It's obviously about  12   hours old.  but there's been   warnings  in Israel for  a while now.  and from   Israeli allies  about the  potential for a multi-front  war.  If  Hezbollah has  ties to join  the fight for  instance, then  I think this   will  escalate  from  what   is  already going to  be. a  Fairly  major.  counter Hamas  effort. to  what could   really  be  a multi-front war  that  Israel  has to  face.  And in  that  situation  I think all bets  are off if   these rules will  be   incredibly  aggressive.  in trying to  be  quite  forward leaning to  ensure.  that  leaning a conflict  and  the such an attack  from   either  Hamas or   if his beloved, they join  doesn't happen  again in the   coming  years.  How's it   goin tin? You take  a look   at  some of these live   images  coming  in  from   Israel  and Hamas.   We're learning. some  new  numbers on  the toll  of  the  wounded and the killed. Some   561,  wounded people  being  treated,  and Israeli.   hospitals,  a numbers for  Palestinians. much  higher,  I'm pulling that  up  right  now for everybody.  1610   wounded in the  territory.   of  Palestine.  following  Israel's  attack, 198 Ian's  killed  and the numbers.   that  I have  right now  at least  77  but I saw  reported  on  saw reported on  moments ago about  a hundred people  and the  Israel side and Israeli.   hospitals have  been  killed   when  we  talk about  those  types of  numbers.   compared to these previous   attacks and these are  dramatic. We're talking about  nearly  2,000 lives being  impacted  and a  singles course  of  a few  hours.  Is  this  much   larger  much  bigger  much   different than  what   we've seen  before? It  100%   is. And that's  owing to the   fact  that  this  wasn't   just  rocket  attacks but  actual infiltration.   individuals from  Hamas,   terrorists  on  the ground   in  Israel, Look, I think  it's  also  worth noting. its  highly unusual. to hear.   Sirens  that  are the  warning,  sirens  in  Israel   about incoming  rocket   attacks.  Going off in   Jerusalem.  less  so   until of the  you but it's   still the and you heard them   happened  both  this   morning.  Not a lot of  them.  It  hasn't  happened. Now  in a few  hours if we  can. She's brought  dry.   gone  down. but I think that   as well as  another you know,  highlight to show,  as an  example,  of  that, this  is   something different about the  intensity of  the world  frankly,  How broad?  Hamas  is  trying  to  make  it  as   as well?  All right,   Jonathan, we are  getting a  new statement in  from  the  White House  National Security advisors   from  our White House Press  pool  saying, officials,   briefed the president this   morning on  the appalling  Hamas.  terrorist attacks in   Israel. The president  will continue to  receive  updates and the White House  officials remain  in  close  contact with  Israeli  partners. as  we  continue to  monitor this, we  may be   expecting some sort may  either  a response  or  some   sort of show of solidarity.  from  the American  officials  in Washington.  What   traditionally?  as  these  types of  things  play  out,   what  is  usually the Western  response. so, from  the US,  I think you'd expect   a couple  of  things, I think  you'd expect  the u.s.  to   give  quite a lot of  leeway.  for Israel  to respond.  However,  decides to   respond.  you will  not see  a lot of  condemnations even   as  the death tolls on  the  destruction increases.  in   the Gaza  Strip.  Eventually   you may see better   back-channel  messages   asking  Israel  to   climb it a little bit  but we're not there right  now.  on  the other.  hand, I  expect  Act.  you know, the  International Community to   allow a number  of  a number   of  Israel. to have a few  days  but you will  see from   Europe, especially  call for   calm. sooner  than  you will   for Israel  call  for the  escalation. probably see   that  from  the Arab  states   as  well. I think the  question  is  going to  be   how intense it  is. And  some of us  just   on Bonilla is going to   really  be  a question. as   well  about whether or not   husband gets  involved   in the  war because if  they   do, it  really  changes the  nature  of  it, you're almost  certainly see by  the way.  a  request from  Israel  for  more  interceptors, for the  Iron Dome,  the defensive  system  we  talked about   earlier That's  request.   That's  usual. You rushed and  filled. But again,  it  can  it's  going to  depend  on   just  how things  go  over   the next  few days. We   this is going to  be  a lot  more  angles  to  this   to come.  than  we  have   right now.  All right,  very   serious.  situation,   They're happening between  Israel  and their in the   Gods. Strip.  What  got us   to this situation?  What  are  the stems of  the current  conflict? Which I understand   goes  back  decades between  these two groups. It does.   That's right.  Okay, look, I think  that the reality  is  Israel   for years is trying to   strategy  with  call to  mow the grass.  too.   not. Come us now. Kabbalah   knock the Palestinian Islamic  Jihad.  back  on  its heels  a little  bit.  undercut   them  and recognize that   they're still going to   they're that? Israel? Doesn't  have  any presence in Gaza   doesn't have  any presents   obviously in  Lebanon.  and  so  it's going  to  have   limited ability to  control  things  are on  the ground.  at the  root  of  this  is   really  a Ron. It's the  Iranian to  provide a lot of   the funding of the   Iranians should provide a  lot of  the weapons Iranians   who have  four years. viewed   from Asin and certainly view   hizballah as  a proxy that   can be  used, against Israel,  went  around View.  Has it as  necessary Now,  that  doesn't  mean  Hamas and hizballah  don't have  independent  decision-making,  they  do.  but it's  nuanced and it's   hard  to imagine  that they  would have  launched  such   an  operation.  without  at least  giving  a heads up.  to  their Irani and  supporters. All right,   Jonathan  certainly a very   right,  situation.  there as   we. continue to report  on   the latest  out of  Israel,  as  well  as  their along the  Gaza  Strip Very  serious.   there. Indeed.  Jonathan  we   appreciate  you joining us.  Anything  that we haven't  talked  about anything   you'd like  to  go  over   before  we let  you go. No.  I think for a couple  of   months  now about Israel  and  Saudi with  u.s.  support  trying  to  talk  about  normalization.  Obviously the  Ibrahim  recordings are out there. I  think it's  gonna be  a real   think about.  what   happens on  the ground, and  how does  that  translate  into  Israel's  relations  with  their Arab  Neighbors.   And with  the broader  Arab region,   which they've been  trying   so  hard. to  create. more   peaceful  agreements  with   to  normalize relations with   all of  those issues  could  get tough,  tied up in this  as well.  But that's  that's   going to  be  for another  day.

CCTV Footages Of Hamas Attack", "uploader": "India Today", "transcript": "I was among a very small group of journalists that was in the audience for a screening of 43 minutes of unedited raw uncensored body cam CCTV traffic camera and mobile footage taken in part by Hamas terrorists it depicts in the most visceral manner the barbarity of what happened on October the 7th none of that footage or at least most of it isn't being put out in public out of 43 minutes only 90 seconds has been released by the Israeli Defense Forces but I saw all of it and I was taking notes here's a full most detailed description of what I saw I sat down for 43 minutes to watch unedited body cam mobile CCTV and other footage that was put together by the Israeli Defense Forces of what happened on October the 7th a grieving but galvanized Israel is bewildered and angry at having to explain to the International Community why it is doing what it is doing in Gaza as a humanitarian crisis looms there Israel is wondering whether the international focus is Shifting away from how it all started so here over 43 minutes I sat to watch what the Israeli Defense Forces had put together this is where it started the first clip opens with the smiling excited face of a Hamas terrorist in the back of a Toyota pickup truck waving his AK-47 in the air with him are four others holding tight to the sides of the truck as it speeds along a Dusty track all dressed in black with the signature green Hamas headband after a few words in Arabic the man filming the video begins in Allah bir chant and is joined by the others the second clip one that the IDF included in 90 seconds of footage that was made public is a dash cam video taken from a civilian car as the driver approaches he sees armed men on the road this isn't an unusual sight in highly militarized Israel but one of the men on the road waves at the car and then fires right at it the panicked driver steps on the gas to speed past but the car is peppered with bullets cracking the glass the driver clearly hit by the time loses control and the car greins off its part and smashes into a parked [Music] [Applause] SUV two Hamas terrorists are then seen venturing into a kibuts a black dog likely a labor door appears and runs towards the two Hamas men the man wearing the body cam fires three shots killing the dog instantly on the [Applause] track the next clip that I saw is almost too terrible too disturbing to describe it features a father and his two sons the opening scene is the three of them cowering in fear in one of the rooms of their house which has just been invaded by Hamas terrorists as they try to escape from that house two terrorists enter the frame and then point blank they execute the father in front of his sons the blood from his gunshot wound spatters their faces and their bodies and naked and shivering they bolt back into the house once inside CCTV cameras capture the two brothers wailing wondering why they're still alive the Elder boy still a minor tends to his younger brother asks if he can see well both their faces completely covered in blood one can only imagine their trauma outside a separate CCTV camera captures the mother who is so far completely ignorant of what has happened arriving back home with two security guards and when she she sees her husband she simply collapses the next picture is a still image it's a picture of an infant in diapers with three gunshot wound including one in the head it's an unblurred version of the same image that the Israeli foreign Ministry released days after the October 7th attack in the wake of the beheaded baby's report report from kibuts Kfar aah more Stills show a completely charred infant the head of either an infant or a toddler more charred infants and a dog shot dead in a living room two still pictures show an Isis flag on the floor followed by pictures of a woman shot dead in a baby play room and another slumped with gunshot wounds in a laundry room the next item is the full audio clip of a young Hamas terrorist who phones his parents in Gaga during the attack another home invasion by a group of Hamas terrorists show them entering what appears to be a study one of the home's occupants is clearly under the table though it's not clear if he or she is alive or short earlier the terrorists chant Allah abbar and fire onto the [Music] table one of the terrorists is holding an American M4 A1 carbine the final sequence of the 43 minutes features a Survivor sifting through a field of Ash and Bone looking for anything that's familiar charred bodies from car toar rooms filled with mangled corpses body parts ashes with burnt organs on them cars with charred bodies inside them a skull lying to one side that is all that is left and this is what Israel wants the world to see this is what Israel wants the International Community not to forget as it continues to focus rightly so on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and then

here was that there are 20 Americans who remain unaccounted for we don't have definitive information but we do believe it's likely that there uh may be hostages who are US citizens who are held in Gaza I would like to begin by reiterating our condolences to the families of those who were killed by Hamas terrorist attacks against Israel including the 14 American citizens who we know have died the department is actively engaging with the families of those US citizens none of us can imagine the grief that they are feeling today and we are doing everything we can in our power to offer them all appropriate Consular assistance I also want to talk about secretary blinken's efforts over the past 4 days since Hamas launched its initial terrorist attack against Israel which have been focused on three key priorities first and foremost the secretary has been engaged with our Israeli Partners to ensure that Israel has everything that it needs to defend itself both President Biden and secretary blinkin have made clear that we stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the government and people of Israel the first tranch of security assistance is on its way and will arrive in the coming days and more will follow second the secretary has been working the phones with his foreign counterparts to ensure that anyone who has lines of communication with parties hostile to Israel should use those channels to say that now is not the time to take advantage of this situation the president has made that point clear uh has made that point clearly and forcefully and is one that secretary blinkin has reiterated in his calls with leaders in the region third the secretary has been intensely focused on securing the release of all hostages held in Gaza there are a number of countries who have the ability to deliver messages to Hamas and we have made clear to those countries that they should urge Hamas to release all hostages immediately this is a matter we take incredibly seriously finally I'd like to announce that secretary blinkin will be traveling to Israel in the coming days to engage our Israeli Partners directly about the situation on the ground and how we Contin can continue to best support them in their fight against the terrorists who launched these horrific attacks our support for Israel is unwavering and the secretary looks forward to meeting with senior leaders in the Israeli government and continuing the discussions he and the president president have been having with them since the initial tax on Saturday and with that Matt uh in the coming days you want to be more our expectation is that we will leave tomorrow and arrive in Israel on Thursday uh okay and is he going to go anywhere else uh I don't have announcements um to

House just said there are 20 roughly 20 Americans missing uh that's correct there are um the last number I had before coming out here was that there are 20 Americans who remain unaccounted for that's a number that has been moving around over the last few days you have one number and then um some of the people who are unaccounted for uh unfortunately U you discover are actually deceased or then some may may turn up but right now the number that we're tracking is 20 and but and you have no idea of those 20 how many of their F you know how many of them do their families believe that they are actually being we don't have definitive information but we do believe it's likely that there uh may be hostages who are US citizens who are held in Gaza oh go ahead we'll start go just beef but can you just explain a little bit more what what the secretary's message will be you said he wants to confer with people but will it be a message of of solidarity will he discuss in depth the the conflict

more than 169,000 active Israeli military personnel and 465,000 reservists Israel has significant land power with more than 2,000 tanks and hundreds of artillery its Arsenal also includes 339 combat capable aircraft including fighter jets well to help us unpack a lot of this uh we're joined Now by Elias Hana who is in bayout he is a retired Lebanese General and a military analyst thank you very much for your time sir uh first of all when we run through that list of the capabilities the military capabilities of Israel how worried should Hamas and those living inside Gaza B right now I mean they have to be worried but they have chosen to go into the offense because this is the first time they made like they waged the uh offensive campaign inside occupied Palestine this is the first time because now they are measuring their success that they are going into occupied land and then fighting and they were preparing and planning to stay and fight uh uh in the near abroad of Gaza however they have really uh they have they have to calculate I mean the different scenario because when you go to war you plan for the worst case scenario and you hope for the best so they have they have had in their mind that uh at one time they have to withdraw to Gaza and uh waiting for maybe big operation Land The Invasion for uh Gaz so they have to be uh prepared for that as far as logistic is concerned as far as tactics is concerned and at bringing and pulling the the Israeli IDF into Gaza it's like something you know very dangerous for for Israel however uh when you have like this emergency cabinet and U calling like 300,000 troops and then massing these kind of you know tanks and uh you know armored vehicles around Gaza it means that there is something is coming just staying with Israel I mean they were clearly surprised by what happened on Saturday morning and we heard from Israel's military Chief of Staff just a short time ago he said we will learn we will investigate but now is the time for War what exactly do you think that Israel will be trying to achieve in in the days now before potential escalation into the next phase of this War I think that's there's must be some proportionality I mean this surprise and this losses for Israel uh you know intelligence failure they have to do something at least equal in order to erase all of that so maybe there is three main objectives dismantle Hamas or destroy Hamas then freeing the hostages and then maybe avoiding trying to avoid collateral damage which is not the case today so these three objectives are really contradictory with with each other you know what I mean so it's like a war and trying to really dismantle Hamas or paralyze Hamas in Gaza now as we've we've seen over the last few days there has been a huge buildup of uh troops along the border with Gaza from a military point of view what would happen if Israel was to send ground troops into Gaza what would play out from that moment on I think maybe we are we are witnessing now the first phase with is really softening the ground preparing the ground this is the first one hitting like the center of gravity of Hamas all infrastructure and pushing the people to go uh toward Egypt maybe to this Corridor human humanitarian Corridor this is the first phase the second phase is maybe going into Gaza but before going into Gaza they have to go uh by force then they have to bypass the mines so they have to uh uh bypass the anti-tank weapon and then maybe the tunnel so however I think that Israelis will choose maybe maybe According to some articles and Analysis that maybe they will try to go and divide Gaza in the middle because in Gaza if you want to do something you have to to look into three main things main pillars uh demography where is he in the demography it's in Gaza City I mean you have to look for topography and geography maybe in in the middle near D balah from the Gaza border into the the coast to the Mediterranean Sea that is like six kilometers According to some analyst maybe Israel will try to divide Gaza into two parts however going into Gaza can they stay inside uh what would be the theory of victory for Netanyahu Hamas what is after Hamas so this is the whole issue now maybe it's a little bit blurred yes and it certainly is now as we know Hamas is holding a number of Israeli captives I mean how does that affect what could happen from a military point of view I mean there will be a hindrance for you know for the Israelis to go inside and maybe the American are sending with more military uh means to Naim Airbase in in NE they are sending some troops of the Delta Force this kind of Delta Force they are specialized in uh uh freeing hostages would these guys participate I don't think so and maybe they are will be like advisory however Israel can I mean Hamas can use these hostages maybe as a human shield that put them and this distribute them in many many issue and it depends on Israel will'll go and hit these targets I mean there is an Israel like the protocol of Hannibal uh when a soldier is kidnapped and you see him uh it's better to kill him as well as the kidnapper because a Dead Soldier is better than a hostage okay well thank you so much for that it'll be fascinating to see exactly what plays out over the next few days and weeks thank you so much that is Elias Hana for us a

death and suffering of many innocent lives war is a defeat every war is a defeat let us pray for peace in Israel and Palestine and this was the scene in Istanbul where thousands of people marched to

erdogan says turkey air will ramp up its diplomatic efforts to achieve calm on behalf of Tura and in light of this morning's events in Israel we invite all parties to act reasonably and to stay away

Kuwait crowds also marched in support for Palestinians in Gaza let's head to the US now where President Joe Biden has been speaking on the phone with Benjamin Netanyahu our state department correspondent Roselyn Jordan joins us live now from Washington DC Ros what more do we know about the content of this phone call well according to a statement just released by The White House the US President Joe Biden told the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the US stands with Israel and that military assistance which Israel has requested for its Defense Forces is on its way to Israel we don't know specifically what is being sent but it is worth pointing out that the Pentagon has uh said in the past uh day or so that the defense secretary Lloyd Austin is Consulting with yav galad the Israeli defense minister about what uh support the uh Defense Forces need in order to repel this attack that was launched by Hamas early on Saturday we also uh note from the White House statement that the president said that active diplomacy has been conducted and continues to be conducted in order to try to bring this war between Hamas and Israel to a swift conclusion without further loss of life and certainly to uh try to uh help recover those persons who were kidnapped by Hamas and taken to to Gaza in the last 24 hours plenty of moving parts to the story thank you so much rosin Jordan live for us there let's bring in sheab branzi who joins us from the UN the United Nations security Council will hold an emergency meeting very shortly sheab what are we expecting if anything in terms of its power to deescalate the situation well we expect that meeting in about an hour and a half's time just over an hour and a half it's interesting the format of the meeting has led to some questions as to what exactly can be achieved in a from a from a security from the security Council in its official capacity because originally we understand the that malter asked for this to be a private meeting of the UN Security Council so that is a closed meeting the public wouldn't be able to see what was going on but that the affected parties in this crisis Israel and Palestine would be able to attend and participate but then that was changed to Clos consultations of the UN Security Council so that is not a formal meeting of the UN Security Council and only the current members of the UN Security Council can participate not the Israeli and pal the Israeli and Palestinian representatives to the UN we expect them to be briefed by the UN special representative for Middle East peace the Middle East peace process to wenner's land beyond that we don't have much more information as to what's on the agenda we do know however that the Israeli ambassador to the UN is about to speak to reporters outside the security Council within the next 10 minutes we'll be looking at that we'll also be trying to catch representatives from the various missions on their way into their security council meeting we've been hearing particularly from Amnesty International and other International organizations that the root causes of this violence need to be addressed I mean How likely is that going to be the case at this meeting currently though we've just had very kind of boilerplate condemnations from certainly the Western Nations and Brazil against hamas's incursion into Israel the UAE has asked for a resumption or reinvigoration of What's called the quartet that is the UN the US EU and Russia which was supposedly overseeing some sort of peace process but clearly you know what's clear is and what I think a lot of the reporting and the and the guests you've been talking to have said is there has been the sense of complacence see that this is all basically this is all just going to keep quiet I to be honest actually there's that pivotal moment of the UN General Assembly right here just just last month when Netanyahu the the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu brandished a map of the new Middle East at the UN General Assembly on which there was no mention of the Palestinians it was just various Arab states and Israel and you have to look back then at that pivotal moment of the UN General Assembly as to I think we we'll all be looking back at that particular moment clearly as far as Benjamin Netanyahu was concerned the Palestinian question was over but clearly Hamas had other ideas the historical context must be considered you're right thank you so much sheab branzi at the United Nations for us let's head to London now where Harry forcett is standing by Harry a number of European nations have increased their security as a result of this conflict in the past two days how are they trying to reassure their citizens uh that's right a number of European nations talking about the potential threats to their Jewish citizens the Jewish communities so we've heard from the French that they plan to increase protection at schools and synagogues the police here in London talking about increased patrols and also planning for potential uh protests in the coming days uh presumably looking forward to the kind of Israeli attack on Gaza that we might be expecting in the coming days and any protests against that also so in the last few minutes we've seen a video from the British prime minister Rishi sunak in which he talked about this being no moment for equivocation and that he would be unequivocal in blaming Hamas and its supporters for what was taking place inside Israel Palestine at the moment also saying that he'd spoken to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and offered Britain steadfast support and any assistance that Israel might need that was one of four conversations that the Israeli Prime Minister had during the course of the afternoon on Sunday he also spoke to the German leader uh the Ukrainian president and the prime minister of Italy as well and so there is this continued very strong support for Israel and very strong condemnation of the kind of largescale Civilian killing that was carried out by those Hamas fighters on Saturday and also the uh kidnappings of some of those people and the taking them inside Gaza uh there are certainly growing reports that many of those people or Le several of them may be foreign Nationals uh there is one missing Britain for example so increasing levels of concern there's also been one line from the United Nations world food program based in Rome they are calling for the opening and the maintaining of a humanitarian food Corridor into Gaza uh ahead of what everyone is expecting to be this very large scale ramping up of the Israeli military action really appreciate the update Harry forcet in London for us"}, "sxpheGbEHB0": {"url":

American citizens killed parents butchered using their bodies to try to protect their children stomach turning reports of being babies being killed entire family slain young people massacred while attending a musical festival to celebrate peace to celebrate peace women raped assaulted paraded as trophies families hid Their Fear for hours and hours desperately trying to keep their children quiet to avoid drawing attention and thousands of wounded alive but carrying with them the bullet holes and the shrapnel wounds and the memory of what they endured you all know these traumas never go away there's still so many families desperately waiting to hear the fate of their loved ones not knowing if they're alive or dead or hostages infants in their mother's arms grandparents and wheelchair Holocaust Survivors abducted and Hell hostage hostages whom Hamas has now threatened to execute in violation of every code of human morality it's aor the brutality of amas these bloodthirstiness brings to mind the worst the worst Rampages of Isis this is Terrorism but sadly for the Jewish people it's not new this attack is brought to the surface painful memories and the scar is left by a millennia of anti-Semitism and genocide of the Jewish people so in this moment we must be Crystal Clear we stand with Israel we stand with Israel and we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens defend itself and respond to this attack there's no justification for terrorism there's no excuse Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian people's right to dignity and self-determination the state of purpose is the annihilation of the state of Israel and the murder of Jewish people they use Palestinian civilians as human Shields mamas offers nothing but Terror and bloodshed with no regard to who pays the price the loss of innocent life is heartbreaking like every nation in the world Israel has the right to respond indeed has a duty to respond to these vicious attacks I just got off the phone with a third call with prime minister Netanyahu and I told him the United States experience with is experiencing already response would be swift decisive and overwhelming we also discussed how democracies like Israel and United States are stronger and more secure when we act according to the rule of law terrorists per purposely Target civilians kill them we uphold the laws of war law of War it matters there's a difference today Americans across the country are praying for all those families that have been ripped apart a lot of us know how it feels it leaves a black hole in your chest when you lose family feeling like you're being sucked in the anger the pain the sense of hopelessness this is what they mean by a human tragedy an atrocity on an appalling scale we're going to continue to stand United supporting the people of Israel who are suffering unspeakable losses and opposing the hatred and violence of terrorism my team has been in near constant communication with our Israeli partners and partners all across the region and the world from the moment this Crisis began we're surging additional military assistance including ammunition and interceptors to replenish Iron Dome we're going to make sure that Israel does not run out of these critical assets to defend its cities and its citizens my Administration has consulted closely with Congress throughout this crisis when Congress returns we're going to ask them to take urgent action to fund the National Security requirements of our critical Partners this is not about party or politics it's about the security of our world the security of the United States of America we now know that American citizens are among those being held by Hamas I've directed my team to share intelligence and deploy additional experts from across the United States government to consult with and advise Israeli counterparts on hostage recover recovery efforts because as president I I have no higher priority than the safety of Americans being held hostage around the world the United States has also enhanced our military force posture in the region to strengthen our deterrence the Department of Defense has moved the USS Gerr Ford carrier strike group to the Eastern Mediterranean and bolstered our fighter aircraft presence and we stand ready to move in additional assets as needed let me say again any country any organization anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation I have one word don't don't our hearts may be broken but our resolve is clear yesterday I also spoke with the leaders of France Germany Italy and UK to discuss the latest developments with our European allies and coordinate our United response this comes on on top of days of steady engagement with Partners across the region we're also taking steps at home in cities across the United States of America police departments have stepped up security around centers for of Jewish life the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are working closely with state and local law enforcement and Jewish Community Partners to identify and disrupt any domestic threat that could emerge in connection with these horrific attacks this is a moment for the United States to come together to grieve with those who are mourning let's be real clear there is no place for hate in America not against Jews not against Muslims not against anybody we reject we reject what we reject is Terrorism we condemn the indiscriminate evil just as we've always done that's what America stands for you know just over 50 years ago I was thinking about it this morning talking the Secretary State the Vice President in my office over 50 years ago as a young Senator I visited Israel for the first time as a newly elected Senator and I had a long long trip a meeting with golden Mayer in her office just before the Kor war and I guess she could see the consternation of my face as she described what was being faced they were facing we walked outside in that that sort of hallway outside her office to have some photo she looked at me all of a sudden and said would you like to have a photograph and so I got up and followed her out we're standing there silent looking at the Press she could tell I guess I was concerned she leaned over and whispered to me she said don't worry Senator Biden we have a secret weapon here in Israel my word is what she said we have no place else to go we have no place else to go for 75 years Israel is stood as the only guarantor security of

Benjamin Netanyahu in just four days US President Joe Biden denounced the recent hamus attack on Israel as pure unate evil Biden asked Congress to provide additional military assistance on top of the 3.8 billion the US sends annually the White House confirms Munitions and missile interceptors are on route to Israel to replenish its Iron Dome rocket Interceptor system and we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens defend itself and respond to this attack the US has also pledged intelligence but won't provide soldiers to support Israel's military it's also not urging restraint as Biden compared the actions of Hamas to the Islamic State which murdered hostages starting in 2014 in Syria and Iraq the brutality of Hamas these bloodthirstiness brings to mind the worst the worst Rampages of Isis this is Terrorism the Biden Administration has reiterated its commitment to a two-state solution to resolve the Israeli Palestinian conflict but Biden's speech failed to offer support for Palestinian civilians instead he claimed moral High Ground between the United States and Israel in comparison to Hamas terrorists per purposely Target civilians kill them we uphold the laws of war a law of War it matters there's a difference but that's not true not historically in past United States and Israeli conflicts or now and in the case of Israel its defense minister has halted all electricity food and water to Gaza for the foreseeable future elements necessary to sustain civilian life Kimberly hit Al jazer the White House and Hamas have released a statement in response to President Biden's condemnation of the group they say his comments constitute an attempt to cover up the Israeli occupation government's crimes and terrorism against the Palestinian people and that Biden's speech did not point to the massacr committed by the Israeli occupation of forces against the Palestinian people let's bring in Ramy curri he's a distinguished public policy fellow at the American University of Beirut he joins us live from Boston Ramy always good to have you here uh look there's already this war of narratives in this conflict ever since uh the US announced this unwavering support for Israel we've heard Israeli officials declare Palestinians as human animals and proclaimed their intentions to commit crimes uh Against Humanity how worrying is this narrative it is worrying uh it's been going on for many many years uh it's been one of the success stories of the Zionist Israeli public relations uh and lobbying campaigns in the United States across all society and the media and the movies education politics um and uh the result is that the American president uh the strongest man in the country who influences the country more than anybody else probably has come out in excessive support of anything that Israel wants it's quite extraordinary the intensity and the scope of what Biden said and his passion as he said it was also quite unusual for him um and he basically continued the process that has been going on for decades since really since the 1967 war um of of supporting Israel militarily and economically and protecting it diplomatically at the UN and at the RCC and anywhere where Israel may be held accountable the make sure that doesn't happen uh the danger here Ry let me just jump in here because they're pushed for time I mean how is this war and the narrative playing out in the US media particularly as we are already in the 2024 election cycle and President Biden has an important domestic audience to play to it plays out very clearly by uh having very very few Palestinian authentic Palestinian voices a torrent of Israeli voices officials former ambassadors current officials um and an intense Focus uh on the in the mainstream media television is particularly on the families in Israel who have been worrying about their children who they can't find they don't know if they're dead or if they've been taken prisoner and there's this really tear-jerking uh short stories in the TV about these families and they're very powerful uh and there's they now do them uh five six seven seven times a day you see them almost on every American TV station you don't see the equivalent about Palestinians um and also you know we know the names of the Israelis we know the families in their living rooms but we not know anything all we know about Gaza is that Israelis are bombing it in selfdefense and this has become a very clear pattern uh that permeates not just the media but also the public political sphere at the national level where Israel concentrates its uh its lobbying and its and its pressure campaigns which which have succeeded and the last point now is that there the Israelis with complicity by many Americans are trying to silence the voices of Palestinians or Pro Palestinian Progressive Americans in universities and labor unions and media and other places and and this is now being fought out in the courts Ramy we know the US government is a signatory to both the Geneva conventions and the genocide convention which means it has obligation under international law uh to prevent war crimes is this a responsibility that the US is failing to shoulder do you think yes the US and many other countries Great Britain and many other Western countries uh there's two things here you have these individuals who are politicians and politicians say whatever they need to say to gain the public support or financial backing of donors or votes at that moment and the second point is that these are especially when you look at the US the UK and some other countries these are Colonial Powers it's not the old style colonialism of the 19th century it's colonialism where these countries feel that what they say how they act how they dress how they behave their values should be the ones that all the world follows and they set the rules and everybody else should follow they can break the rules if they want but nobody else should break them Ramy just a final quick thought to you I mean many experts say this is not a conflict that has a military solution and in terms of preventing further loss of Israeli and Palestinian lives The Way Forward is to address the historical source of this and that the US must end what many see as complicity in Israeli apartheid and the dehumanization of the Palestinians so what is the way forward just briefly Remy there has to be a buildup of demand to do this within the United States and I've experienced this myself over the last five decades that I've been in and out of the us and the anti-vietnam war movement the environmental movement the women's rights movement the Civil Rights Movement these took years and years and years to develop enough popular mobilization and support to force the national leaders in Washington to change their policy apartheid the Americans didn't want to change the but they were forced to in the end to go against apartheid in South Africa so it'll take time Ramy curri many thanks for your thoughts and your analysis Ramy thank you very much indeed"}, "o3tCVLwb_wE": {"url":

YOUNG PEOPLE BEHEADED, FAMILIES BURNED ALIVE. PARENTS EXECUTED IN FRONT OF THEIR CHILDREN, CHILDREN EXECUTED IN FRONT OF THEIR PARENTS. SO MANY TAKEN HOSTAGE IN GAZA.

THE U.S. HAS TOLD ISRAEL TO DELAY ANY TO ALLOW TIME FOR AID TO REACH GAZA, WHICH REMAINS IN THE SWELLS OF A DIRE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS. I ASKED PRESIDENT BIDEN IF HUMANITARIAN AID WAS GETTING INTO GAZA FAST ENOUGH. HIS RESPONSE, QUOTE, NOT FAST ENOUGH. JOINING ME NOW IN ISRAEL, NBC'S -- AND JOSH LETTERMAN. WHAT MORE ARE WE LEARNING ABOUT THEIR PLANNING AND STRATEGY LEADING UP TO THE OCTOBER 7th TERRORIST ATTACK? >> WELL, WE ARE LEARNING THERE WERE SOME CLEAR PLAN TO TAKE HOSTAGES AS YOU REPORTED THERE. WE SAW AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE TWO ELDERLY LADIES WHO WERE LET GO, CROSSING OVER INTO EGYPT YESTERDAY, THAT THEY HAD THAT INTRICATE NETWORK WHICH THEY LED TO WOMEN, SEPARATING THEM INTO GROUPS. THE WOMEN ALSO DESCRIBED HOW THEY WERE ABDUCTED AND PUT ON THE BACK OF A MOTORCYCLE. THAT WAS THE ORDER OF THE TWO. HER DAUGHTER THERE WAS TRANSLATING WITH HER MOTHER SITTING BY HER IN A WHEELCHAIR. WE ARE ALSO LEARNING, I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING TO THE PERSON THAT IS CLOSE TO THE NEGOTIATIONS. SO FAR, THERE ARE REAL HOLDS UP -- HOLDUPS IN TERMS OF GETTING PEOPLE, THE NEXT BATCH OF HOSTAGES WILL HOPEFULLY BE RELEASING MORE PEOPLE. THERE ARE DISAGREEMENTS SURROUNDING SOME KEY QUESTIONS. THE REPORTS ARE THAT THOSE QUESTIONS REVOLVE AROUND THE SUPPLY OF FUEL TO THE GAZA STRIP. THIS IS WHERE WE ARE NOW. WE HAVE TWO SETS OF RELEASES FOR THE PEOPLE, FOUR OUT OF 200. RIGHT NOW, IT APPEARS THAT ANY FUTURE RELEASE BASED ON NEGOTIATIONS IS NOT GOING TO YIELD ANY POSITIVE RESULTS. AT LEAST IMMINENTLY, THAT IS WHAT I CAN REPORT TO YOU. >> IT IS REMARKABLE TO SEE THAT THIS IS LESS THAN 24 HOURS AFTER BEING RELEASED. ARE PEOPLE IN ISRAEL FRUSTRATED THAT IT HASN'T BEGUN YET? ARE THEY FACING PRESSURE FROM THE FAR RIGHT WING MEMBERS OF THIS PARTY TO LAUNCH THE OFFENSIVE? >> I CAN TELL YOU, JUST AND DOLLY, THE PEOPLE I SPEAK WITH IN ISRAEL, OBVIOUSLY, I'M NOT GOING UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY, BUT WHERE I AM, THERE IS IMMENSE SUPPORT FOR MILITARY OPERATION. JUST THE LATEST POLL THAT WAS PUBLISHED CONDUCTED A COUPLE OF WEEKS AFTER THE ATTACK SHOW THAT 90% OF ISRAELIS ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE MILITARY OPERATION. THERE ARE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE URGING THE ISRAELI LEADERSHIP TO HOLD OFF. THAT WAY, THERE CAN BE ROOM FOR MORE HOSTAGES TO NEGOTIATE TO ALLOW FOR THE RELEASE OF MORE HOSTAGES. PUBLIC OPINION, THOUGH IT IS AGAINST NETANYAHU, 80% ARE VERY MUCH OPPOSED  TO HOW THE PRIME MINISTER'S LEADING THE COUNTRY. MANY ACCUSE HIM OF HAVING ALLOWED THIS ATTACK TO TAKE PLACE. PRETTY MUCH, THAT SAME PERCENTAGE ARE IN SUPPORT OF MILITARY ACTION AGAINST HAMAS . >> IN TEL AVIV, THANK YOU. I WANT TO TURN OUT TO JOSH LETTERMAN. TURNING NOW TO THE HUMANITARIAN SITUATION, IS AID STILL COMING THROUGH TODAY? >> GAVE, OVER THE LAST THREE DAYS, WE DID SEE THE SHIPMENT FINALLY MOVE INTO THE BORDER, CROSSING FROM EGYPT INTO GAZA. THE HOPE IS THAT THAT HAS CREATED A PARADIGM WHERE THERE IS A SYSTEM IN PLACE. THERE IS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN\nTHE EGYPTIANS, AND PEOPLE IN THE EGYPTIANS, AND PEOPLE IN ISRAEL. AS FAR TODAY, WE HEARD THEM SAYING THAT MORE TRUCKS ARE MOVING THROUGH THE BORDER. NBC NEWS HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO INDEPENDENTLY VERIFY THAT. REGARDLESS, WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF 8-20 TRUCKS A DAY. THIS IS COMPARED TO THE NEED OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE GAZA STRIP. THEY SAY IT IS SOMETHING LIKE 3% OF WHAT USED TO GO ON TO THE STRIP BEFORE THE WAR, AND IT HAS MOVED IN ON A DAILY BASIS.\nIT HAS BEEN WHOLLY INSUFFICIENT. IT HAS BEEN WHOLLY INSUFFICIENT. >> AND THEY ARE CALLING FOR HUMANITARIAN CEASE-FIRE. TODAY, THE WHITE HOUSE REITERATED IT BELIEVES THAT WOULD ONLY HELP HAMAS. IS THAT REALISTIC? THE IDEA OF A CEASE-FIRE? >> AS FAR AS ISRAEL IS CONCERNED, NO. THEY SAID THAT WOULD BE UNILATERALLY DISARMING AFTER THIS KILLED WELL OVER 1000 PEOPLE IN ISRAEL. OF COURSE, THE CONCERN HAS BEEN WHETHER NOT HAVING A CEASE-FIRE MAKES IT HARDER TO GET CIVILIAN HOSTAGES OUT OF GAZA. ALSO, HOW THE MAINTENANCE OF THESE AIRSTRIKES IS MAKING IT SO HARD TO GET HUMANITARIAN AID. IT IS REALLY -- THE PALESTINIAN POPULATION IN GAZA. I WANT YOU TO HEAR HOW THE ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER RESPONDED TO THESE GROWING CALLS FOR A CEASE-FIRE. WATCH. >> HOW YOU CAN AGREE TO A CEASE- FIRE WITH SOMEONE SWORN TO KILL AND DESTROY YOUR OWN EXISTENCE? HOW? THE PROPORTIONAL RESPONSE TO THE MASSACRE IS A TOTAL\nDESTRUCTION! DESTRUCTION! A TOTAL DESTRUCTION FOR HAMAS. >> I HAVE TO DICTATE YOU, GABE, THEY ARE -- BY SOME  COMMENTS HE MADE AT THE U.N. TODAY, SUGGESTING THAT THEY NEED TO BE VIEWED IN CONTEXT OF WHAT PALESTINIANS HAVE FACED OVER THE MANY DECADES.

can't keep it oh that's the view from the balcony there is literally no view you can't see anything Israel's intense shelling and bombardments of Gaza has flattened residential buildings mosques hospitals refugee camps and even un shelter schools we W really close to my house that's my window right now that's the view hospitals in Gaza are overwhelmed eight of them are facing severe shortages of essential medical supplies and equipment and have no way of accessing these items due to the siege people in the street are calling for ambulance but but there is no [Music] ambulance but why is Gaza being subject to a blockade to understand this we need to turn the pages of History Gaza was part of historical Palestine before the creation of the state of Israel in 1948 when then Zionist paramilitary groups violently expelled nearly 800,000 Palestinians from their homes in what's known as the neba to seek Refuge many Palestinians fled to Gaza after the 1948 1949 Arab Israeli War Gaza was placed under Egyptian Administration and remained so until the 1967 6-day war when Israel emerged Victorious and occupied Gaza along with the West Bank and East Jerusalem following the expansion of Israeli territory millions of Palestinians found themselves having to live under military occupation in the occupied West Bank and Gaza during the '90s Israel used border closure tactics on gazans arbitrarily opening and closing the Border whenever they wanted and introduced a permit system making permits very hard to get and thereby restricting their movement in and out of the occupied territory in 2005 Israel withdrew its forces and settlements from Gaza but continued to build illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank in 2007 following the election victory of Hamas a political party that Israel the US and some other countries classify as a terrorist group Israel initiated a Siege imposing an air Land and Sea blockade on Gaza as a form of collective punishment effectively cutting it off from the outside world gaza's economy has been in shamble since as The Enclave has virtually no industry and suffers from a chronic lack of food water fuel and electricity due to the siege around half of the population is unemployed and more than 2third are reliant on development aid from [Music] donors over the years Palestinians in both Gaza and occupied West Bank have protested Israel's violent foundation and ongoing occupation that have left them dispossessed of their land and living under foreign military rule gan's desperation and desire for self-determination has led to several major eruptions of violence between Israel and Gaza with Wars breaking out in 2008 2012 2014 and 2021 with no signs of deescalation between Hamas and Israel following hamas's operation alak safad on October 7 Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to forcefully Avenge the attacks through intense bombardments by and a Complete Siege of the territory a Complete Siege not only exacerbates an already dire situation for the 2.3 million residents of The besieged Enclave half of whom are children but it also means more fatalities and a worsening humanitarian crisis so why are analysts calling The Siege a form of collective punishment the term Collective punishment refers to sanctions administrative measures and various forms of harassment inflicted Upon A Wider group of people in response to the alleged actions of individuals within that group by imposing a total blockade of Gaza Israel is not just targeting and punishing Hamas but it is also harming all 2.3 million residents Trapped In The Enclave netanyahu's call for Palestinians to leave Gaza due to Israel's bombing campaign has also Fallen flat Gaza has seven designated Crossings meant for the movement of goods and people in and out of the territory but The Enclave is closed from all sides residents are literally cajan side and unable to escape as Israel has closed the ARs Crossing and the Raa Crossing controlled by Egypt has been hit by bombs does this mean Israel is breaking International laws well according to article 33 of the fort Geneva Convention no protected person may be punished for an offense he or she has not personally committed Collective penalties and likewise all measures of intimidation or of terrorism are prohibited International humanitarian law categorically bans

many others are left to Grapple with their loss in an effort to Aid civilians trapped in Gaza the Palestinian representative to the UN pleaded for humanitarian assistance we will continue the uh contacts with everyone including the security Council so that the International Community to shoulder its responsibility in stepping to the to the picture and in putting uh an end to this Onslaught against our people but more importantly that would require of course sending humanitarian assistance to the uh 2 million3 uh of Palestinians who live in the Gaza Strip uh there has to be a humanitarian intervention in order to uh to avoid uh a looming catastrophe echon his words the World Health Organization want of dwindling medical supplies we need more trauma supplies uh we need intravenous fluids we need bandages we need anesthetic equipment we need surgical equipment uh and you know all the different supplies uh equipment medicines that you may need uh for for major traumatic injuries whether they be head wounds chest wounds abdominal wounds uh uh fractured Lings uh and burns and so on as diplomatic efforts to open humanitarian corridors to people in Gaza continue There is fear that for many Palestinians help me not arrive soon enough and for more on this we're going to go over now to Jerusalem and talk to shy Lo who is spokesperson with the Norwegian Refugee Council thank you for coming on to the program your organization is on the ground in Gaza what are you hearing from there yeah so I just spoke about 30 minutes ago to my colleague in Gaza uh he said that last night was an extremely difficult night the bombardments were continuing uh all throughout the night he told me of a number of air strikes that resulted in massive Ian casualties uh this morning uh or last night rather uh the house behind where my colleague was staying was hit with an air strike thankfully he and his my colleague and his family were unharmed but because of the blackout uh they were unable to even clean up safely the glass that had shattered from their Windows um because they just could not see in the dark this morning he described to me challenges in just getting around uh Gaza shortages in bread uh being able to to make the way make a make it to be able to to navigate the streets which are filled with rubble and difficult to to navigate the situation in Gaza is truly um unbelievable in terms of the the humanitarian crisis we're facing yeah Shina and part of the reason this is so acute is because it's it's apparent that no Aid is getting into into Gaza because of uh the blockade what do you fear if this blockade continues I mean we are fearing an even larger humanitarian catastrophe than the one that we're already witnessing right now uh the supplies in Gaza are very limited there already was a Siege on Gaza even prior to this total siege that was imposed over the last week and so what we are hearing from our colleagues is that supplies are dwindling food prices are already on the rise bakeries are saying that they have less than a week supply of of material of of uh of food uh and and ingredients I mean this is this is literally going to be 2.3 million Palestinians uh trapped inside of Gaza with no relief in sight uh unless unless there's uh unless there's an opening of humanitarian corridors for the entry of of Aid and other Provisions sh I want us to talk specifically here about the uh the aid that's needed um in respect to the emergency response helping the wounded uh as as the air strikes and the bombardment on the territory uh continues what needs to happen to be able to save civilian lives I mean first and foremost there needs to be electricity restored to the Gaza Strip hospitals are operating on emergency generators and will soon run out of supplies and fuel for those we need medical equipment medical supplies yesterday there was the announcement that all of the hospital beds in Gaza were full um I mean this is a a a humanitarian catastrophe that is happening before us and and there needs to be uh assistance both in terms of restoration of water electricity fuel um food medicine access to medicine and other uh medical supplies they all need to be let into Gaza immediately all right Shina low is with the Norwegian Refugee Council she's talking to us from Jerusalem we appreciate uh you're coming on to the program Shina thank you thank you and now we are going to go to Gaza where hisam Mana is standing by for us he's a Communications officer with the international Committee of the Red Cross joins me by phone uh it's very difficult right now to establish uh good connections um thank you so much uh for coming on to to the program if you can hear me I'd like to start by just asking you what you're seeing on the ground there where you are what we're seeing is absolutely unprecedented we are witnessing a a catastrophe of um of Hope a crisis and the humanitarian situation uh complete shutdown of the sole uh Power Plant of the Gaza Strip that feeds uh households or what's left of the neighborhoods uh uh and the infrastructure feeding them but also um hospitals um across all the G STP are imped the water and water sector is paralyzed at the moment in the vast areas of the Gaza STP this would lead if the situation continues like this to an environmental crisis because sewage is pumped into or mixing with the with the water you know infrastructure um so this is also an imminent risk that we are alarmed by but focusing on the medical situation in G STP which is a catastrophe the Ministry of Health has called for immediate injury of medical supplies equipment and fuel to run uh keep the hospital running and there are hundreds of seriously injured patients uh who are connected to oxygen supply there are newborns who are living inside incubators and one of the hospitals that include that incubators got damaged and that section in specific was partially damaged uh we have witness targeting of medical uh staff yesterday four of the emergency medical team of the palestin chrisan society uh were IMM were like directly targeted and they were killed um while conducting their humanitarian Mission rescuing injuries um the hospitals now are suffering from Fear shortage in the medical supplies many not most of the ham I I just want to to come in there and continue our conversation I'm hearing you say that you you've witnessed um medical staff being directly targeted that would be of course a very serious um allegation over there perhaps you can expand on that but but also while you're at it Hisham what would you say is most needed right now in in in Gaza the most needed thing in Gaza now is strain the escalation and to to allow the humanitarian Aid fuel food and medic and medication into the G St uh this is the most pressing uh need now to continue saving lives and to prevent the humanitarian situation from further deterioration into a complete full crisis and how long how long do you think um what is your assessment about how long civilians can hold on without help there are still families under the rubble uh some of them lost some of their peers like lost hope of of of having them back some are still the unreachable by the civil defense because the lack of equipment and the lack of safe access to to these locations uh so that's one side of the story the civilians in Gaza like entire neighborhoods were asked to evacuate without clear safe passages and some of like hundreds of families have to relocate for two three times in one day seeking Safe Haven uh there's a crisis of Hope and there's absolute um lack of sense of Safety and Security and now families fear for their children if they're going to witness the next morning yeah his what do you need right now from the International Community uh in in in this regard as as you're talking to us hisam we can see pictures of the devastation uh in Gaza we see buildings that have been raised flattened and and you're telling us there are potentially families and under some of this Rubble what would be your message uh to the International Community um from the uh uh uh Red Cross operating in Gaza right now [Music] yes uh uh there has to be a full respect of the international humanitarian law that calls for the protection of civilians civilian properties medical commissions uh uh this is uh and also um um infrastructure that's uh important and vital to continue feeding people with water energy uh and medical health care this is uh uh the utmost concern of the rcrc and this is what we have been calling for and this is what we have trying to you know to force with the the both sides of the conflict civilians should not pay the heavy cost every single time and every round of escalation they should be not paying uh you know the prize for the failure of a political solution to end this escalation that has been lasting for decades we have been existing here since 1967 in Israel and the occupied territories we have never witnessed that large scale of Devastation in a matter of a few days so uh what we are asking for is uh full Restraint of violence to to protect civilians protect civilian properties to allow the medical missions to reach safely to those who are injured and most importantly now also to allow the entry of the humanitarian Aid the required food medication to save uh 2.3 million people plus all right that is the voice of Hisham Mana he is Communications officer with the international uh Committee of the Red Cross talking to us from Gaza we appreciate that uh Hisham and all the best to you and your colleagues as you continue the work you're doing in Gaza thank you now many of the hundreds of thousands of displaced people in Gaza are seeking help from the United Nation CW visited a family in one un facility where assistance is certain to be stretched to the limit in the coming days they are 13 in all umani alula and her immediate family they found a degree of safety at a un run school not far from the Egyptian border on the first day of the war we saw missiles flying over our heads our neighborhood is dangerous it's on the Eastern side we were afraid to stay home God knows how we got out but we escaped our circumstances are difficult this is not a solution the children need milk and diapers anra can't offer us anything this is our fourth day at the school I have high blood pressure and diabetes and I can't get medication hundreds of thousands have fled like umani Al gul's family most but not all before their homes and neighborhoods were reduced to Rubble Israel is retaliating for the crossb terrorist attacks and hostage taking by Hamas the Israeli Defense Forces say they they are focused on Hamas related targets unra the United Nations relief and works agency is providing shelter in spaces like this it's tight and getting tighter but for umani Al gul's family it seems safer than their [Music] home there are large numbers of Palestinians in unra schools we provide them with Health Care food we provide clean water and also psychological support but the numbers are growing hugely one's capacity is for 150,000 displaced Palestinians and beyond that it is a big problem a financial problem a problem with absorbing all of these people there is also the problem of the people needed to help them Beyond The Limited space in the UN displacement centers each of them is impacted by Israel's Complete Siege of the Gaza Strip it's cut off food water medicines and electricity we were living in a safe place the war broke out the strikes began without warning and we were forced to leave we walked about 7 km until we arrived here hoping to find a safe place it's not like that here and this is not suitable for living there is no water no food the sewage system is broken it's not suitable for living umani alula and her family will have to get by in a six meter wide room as they wait for an end to what could become a drawn out Siege and War well the White House says that the US is working with Israel and Egypt in an attempt to set up safe corridors for civilians in Gaza Egypt's President also says that he's intensifying efforts to contain this conflict the Rafa Crossing on the Egyptian border was the last hope for gazin trying to flee but it is now closed unverified footage from social media which you see right here claims to show a large crowd near the crossing as bombs were falling nearby the United Nations says the bombardment has displaced more than 260,000 Gins but with the crossing now shut there's little chance of Escape for any of the 2.3 million residents of G well AFP journalist bahir Ami joins me now from Cairo B tell us about the situation right now at the Rafa border crossing uh at this moment the latest information we have is that the raah border crossing has remained closed since yesterday after it was hit by three Israeli air strikes within 24 hours um The Crossing as you said is the only access point into and out of Gaza that is not controlled by Israel uh it is the only potential humanitarian Corridor in the middle of what Israel has announced to be a complete Siege uh between Monday evening and Tuesday afternoon uh there were three year rounds of strikes on the Palestinian side of the border crossing which damaged the facility we have eyewitnesses yesterday seeing saying Egyptian employees were evacuated from the area dozens of Palestinian families who had been trying to get back into Gaza were turned back towards the Egyptian town of Alish um Egypt as you said has set it intents to keep the crossing open has pushed for humanitarian humanitarian Aid to get through uh foreign minister SE shuk said today the government is committed to getting Aid through we know there have been attempts uh on the Egyptian side at least one shipment of Medical Aid from the Egyptian Red cresant made it through on Monday before the first air strike um and ever since calls for Aid of multiplied the latest came today from the meeting of the Arab League foreign ministers uh who also called for the seat to be lifted and then again from the United Nations as you said um so there has been this concerted push to make sure that medicine food fuel Emergency Equipment all make it a Gaza but what that will actually look like remains to be seen yeah we know that before the Border closed Egypt was letting in a limited number of Palestinians um is Egypt now fearing Mass displacement of people I mean is Egypt willing to have a ref Refugee crisis come onto its territory um so the situation now is that Egypt has already committed itself on Aid getting through to Gaza but what it has not done is indicate that it will be accepting refugees at all um Cairo is in a situation it finds historically very complex um again this is the only access point to Gaza not under Israeli control there's a push to allow civilians to come into Egypt um the US has said it is coordinating with both Israel and Egypt to gu safe passage for civilians but that's something Egypt has historically not allowed um there have been no official statements from Egyptian authorities but there is something very telling in the statements that state aligned media have been sharing um which cite high level security forces in saying that Egypt stands solidly against proposals of settling the people of Gaza in Sinai which they say only serves the occupation only the occupation only serves Israel's interests um and there is a historical fear I called by Palestinians and a larger a popular discourse that if Palestinians were to leave their homes in search of safety in the case of attack they would lose their homes um at the same time there is a call for those who would want to leave to be allowed to um and now you're seeing sources very close to the Egyptian government saying that Palestinians are being forced to choose between death under Israeli bombing or displacement from their land yeah um but as you say even in times of relative calm Passage through RAF is very tightly controlled it's prohibitive slow it's expensive bureaucratic limited to humanitarian cases um so what remains to be seen was going to happen but president CeCe was also very careful to release a statement saying that Egypt's National Security is his primary responsibility okay AFP journalist B I mean with the ladies tonight from Cairo bahira thank you"}, "JvlzzpyWYJo": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvlzzpyWYJo", "video_id":

within hours that's just one indicator of the widening humanitarian crisis Iris was speaking of that's affecting Gaza and its population of 2.3 million in a very tight dense space food is running out infrastructure has been widely destroyed Canada and other countries are pledging humanitarian aid but those efforts are being Complicated by the presence of Hamas and the desire to ensure Aid only reaches civilians in such desperate need Hillary Johnstone in Ottawa looking at that part of the story big picture I mean irus was talking about some of it Hillary but give us uh really a full appreciation of the humanitarian situation on the ground in Gaza well how some of the numbers that the United Nations has just released a released rather really paint quite a diet picture of what is happening at this moment inside Gaza so more than 175,000 people who have been internally displaced uh we know that a number of un schools have now been hit have been impacted two of those schools just recently that brings the total of un installations within Gaza to 20 that have now been damaged or destroyed of course that's going to complicate efforts to get help to people who need it you started to hear stories about bakeries that have closed because there are simply no supplies for them to be able to produce any sort of bread or anything that they can then sell to people so food shortages water shortages there are concerns about lack of Sanitation about sewers backing up no access to poble water the fact that that could possibly spread disease very very dire situation inside Gaza right now what we've heard from the world food program is that they are prepared to feed some 800,000 people uh they're saying as many as a million people don't currently have access to water or food they say at this point they've distributed bread to about 73,000 people but of course 73,000 people not even close to the 800,000 or so that they say uh they that need it desperately at this point so for more on the situation uh we spoke with the International Federation of the Red Cross and red crescent here's a little bit of what we heard because a strip is locked I mean the good news in the past is that we had the possibility to bring Aid and for instance our volunteers even today they were distributing some of the stocks that were prepositioning AA for any possible emergency but these talks will finish together with fuel for electricity together with food and water so it really it really I mean there is a desperate cold that in the next days will arrive from Gaza where needs will grow and an enormous scale Heather you mentioned there off the top some of the aid that Canada has pledged and what we've heard from the office of the International Development Minister Ahmed husen is that at Canada will have no contact with Hamas that is the policy or or any terrorist organization saying that that $55 million that they spend on Aid to both Gaza and the West Bank every year that they will work with some of their existing Partners some of these Aid organizations and agencies to make sure that that money gets directly to the people who need it and not into the hands of possible terrorists you were listening Hillary as I was to ER say that she anticipates the humanitarian crisis will really hit even before any ground assault begins that's how quickly the situation is deteriorating what are experts and officials saying about what could happen if help doesn't arrive soon well they're saying that things are only going to get worse we've been showing some of those live images of what the situation looks like already of course we know that with that looming threat of a possible ground Invasion that some of those images uh that things might get worse that things might deteriorate even uh even more even further at this point we've been been hearing from people who are inside Gaza as well saying that at this point they only have 3 or 4 hours of electricity every day of course we were just hearing about the threat that that might be cut off completely at some point we've been speaking with someone who is inside a resident of Gaza here's a bit of what we're hearing is happening is a collective punishment against more than two million Palestinians in the Gaza St Netanyahu and the Israeli Army is asking the Palestinians to get out of Gaza that is unbelievable that is unrealistic two million people are trapped between the Israelis from one side and the Egyptians who are not going to allow uh two million people to to to to move into their own territory uh it it it's so horrific so terrible I've never seen something like this in all of my life and other the other thing we're hearing about our medical supply shortages or even just the fact that these hospitals don't even always have access to clean water or to electricity so of course something that we will continue to monitor throughout the morning"}, "Woj0d0bZJp0": {"url":

unwilling to take in Palestinian refugees from Gaza even as desperate Palestinians in sealed off Gaza try to find Refuge under Israel's Relentless bombardment in retaliation for hamas's brutal October 7th attack the question that some ask is why neighboring Egypt and Jordan don't take them in the two countries which flank Israel on opposite sides and share borders with Gaza and the occupied West Bank Respec have replied with a staunch refusal Jordan already has a large Palestinian population Egyptian president Abdel fata El cissi made his toughest remarks yet on Wednesday saying the current war was not just aimed at fighting Hamas which rules the Gaza Strip but also an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to migrate to Egypt he warned this could wreck peace in the region Jordan's King Abdullah II gave a similar message a day earlier saying no refugees in Jordan no refugees in Egypt their refusal is rooted in fear that Israel wants to force a permanent expulsion of Palestinians into their countries and nullify Palestinian demands for Statehood El cissi also said a mass Exodus would risk bringing militants into Egypt's Sinai Peninsula from where they might launch attacks on Israel endangering the two countries 40-year-old peace treaty here is a look at what is motivating Egypts and Jordan stances displacement has been a major theme of Palestinian history in the 1948 War around Israel's creation an estimated 700,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled from what is now Israel Palestinians refer to the event as the nakba Arabic for catastrophe in the 1967 mid East War when Israel seized the West Bank and Gaza Strip 300,000 more Palestinians fled mostly into Jordan the refugees and their descendants now number nearly 6 million most living in camps and communities in the West Bank Gaza Lebanon Syria and Jordan the diaspora has spread further with many refugees building lives in Gulf Arab countries or the West after fighting stopped in the 1948 War Israel refused to allow refugees to return to their homes since then Israel has rejected Palestinian demands for a return of refugees as part of a peace deal arguing that it would threaten the country's Jewish majority Egypt fears history will repeat itself and a large Palestinian refugee population from Gaza will end up staying for good that's in part because there's no clear scenario for how this war will end Israel says it intends to destroy Hamas for its bloody Rampage and its Southern towns but it has given no indication of what might happen afterward and who would govern Gaza that has raised concerns that it will reoccupy the territory for a period fueling further conflict the Israeli military said Palestinians who followed its order to flee Northern Gaza to the strip's southern half would be allowed back to their homes after the war ends Egypt is not reassured El cissi said fighting could last for years if Israel argues it hasn't sufficiently crushed militants he proposed that Israel house Palestinians in its Negev Desert which neighbors the Gaza Strip until it ends its military operations Egypt has pushed for Israel to allow humanitarian Aid into Gaza and Israel said Wednesday that it would though it didn't say when according to United Nations Egypt which is dealing with a spiraling economic crisis already hosts some 9 million refugees and migrants including roughly 300,000 Sudanese who arrived this year after fleeing their country's War but Arab countries and many Palestinians also suspect Israel might use this opportunity to force permanent demographic changes to wreck Palestinian demands for Statehood in Gaza the West Bank and East Jerusalem which was also captured by Israel in 1967 El cissi repeated warnings Wednesday that an exodus from Gaza was intended to eliminate the Palestinian cause the most most important cause of our region he argued that if a demilitarized Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations there would not be War now all historical precedent points to the fact that when Palestinians are forced to leave Palestinian territory they are not allowed to return back Arab countries fears have only been stoked by the rise under Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of hard-right parties that talk in positive terms about removing Palestinians since the Hamas attack the has become less restrained with some right-wing politicians and media commentators calling for the military to raise Gaza and drive out its inhabitants one lawmaker said Israel should carry out a new nakba on Gaza at the same time Egypt says a mass Exodus from Gaza would bring Hamas or other Palestinian militants onto its soil that might be destabilizing in siai where Egypt's military fought for years against Islamic militants and at one point accused Hamas of backing them Egypt has backed Israel's blockade of Gaza since Hamas took over in the territory in 2007 tightly controlling the entry of materials and the passage of civilians back and forth it also destroyed the network of tunnels under the border that Hamas and other Palestinians used to smuggle Goods into Gaza El cissi warned of an even more destabilizing scenario the wrecking of Egypt and Israel's 1979 Peace deal he said that with the presence of Palestinian militants Sinai would become a base for attacks on Israel Israel would have the right to defend itself and would strike Egyptian territory the peace which we have achieved would vanish from our hands he said all for the sake of the idea of eliminating the Palestinian cause do tell us what

to our warnings these two vehicles here let's zoom in and this is the same two vehicles and you can see the line of Civilian Vehicles trying try trying to go from north to south being blocked by two other [Music] vehicles I'd like to focus on the current situation during the night there were Rockets fired at Tel Aviv and Southern Israel there was still there is still combat in and around the northern part of the Gaza Strip and the IDF continues to operate above the Gaza Strip and to attack different military targets belonging to Hamas now we have called on the civilian population and this isn't news we have called on the civilian population in Gaza City and the northern part of the Gaza Strip to evacuate south south of the Gaza River and that isn't news but what is news is that Hamas has both issued warnings to their civilians not to evacuate and when people didn't listen to those warnings of Hamas they have actually stopped civilians and they have stopped convoys of Gan civilians trying to flee from the situation and listening to our warnings knowing that they are much better off South of the gazi Gaza River than staying in the northern part H there's a picture here on this side where you can see an aerial footage of two vehicles these two vehicles here let zoom in and this is the same two vehicles and you can see the line of Civilian Vehicles trying try trying to go from north to south being blocked by two other vehicles and that corresponds with intelligence and information we have from various sources that Hamas is indeed actively preventing civilians from leaving the South now if that isn't the most Sinister and vile use of civilians during War I I don't know what is but it again goes to show the lack of any value for human life with with the terrorist organization Hamas now there have been reports of a convoy or vehicles of gazans that were going from north to south on salahadin road which is the main street in the Gaza Strip here it goes from north to south and there were reports of gazan casualties now I'd like to say something about reports coming out of the Gaza Strip the Gaza Strip there aren't two governments there there's one government the government is Hamas so when the so-called Gaza Ministry of health issues information the amount of people killed if they were armed people or not if there were men or women or children obviously that information is authorized by Hamas and it it's okay for release by Hamas and it would serve the purposes of Hamas so when you get information if you're a journalist or if you're just listening to what's going on and you get information from the Gaza Strip please be very very skeptical of the veracity and ask yourself why was this information disseminated and how does it serve Hamas and its propaganda purposes and I'd like to show you something this is footage made by local gazin of that incident and you see the explosion there we're going to zoom in you know what we're going to show it again just so you can see it better vehicle's traveling some guys filming and then all of a sudden a big explosion now you can't see it now but we've zoomed in actually we haven't uh people who know how to do it around the world forensic analysis and other people visual imagery experts they've zoomed in and they've enlarged the area of the explosion that that's one of those pictures and here's another picture a little bit zoomed out of the same very incident they've basically isolated the frames and looked and wanted to understand where the explosion started and what it looks like now I'm no forensic expert I wouldn't be able to say if this is a roadside IED or if this is a strike from above but what I am able to say with confidence because we have asked is that the IDF did not purposely strike in that area area there was no targeting of vehicles there was no targeting of civilians specifically because we want the Civ we don't Target civilians anyhow but specifically because we wanted people to go south so it makes no sense for the IDF to have done it who would want to stop those same civilians the same organization that did the roadblocks Hamas now again this isn't conclusive what is conclusive is that we for sure didn't strike on purpose it may have been some kind of a freak accident which I doubt but I think that this visual imagery and by the way both BBC and uh other media outlets and many on Twitter have looked at this and analyzed it and there are questions about what happened here and how that explosion occurred and again any information coming out of the Gaza Strip authorized by Kamas should be treated with Extreme Caution and suspicion because it serves their propaganda purposes we are deployed along the Gaza Strip with our ground forces and we are preparing ourselves for the next stage of operations we again call on the people of Northern Gaza Gaza City and all the northern environment in this area here to go south listen to our warnings we are saying that there's going to be significant military activities here and we want we urge the civilians to evacuate for their own safety and I think it is appalling that Hamas isn't letting people to evacuate let that sink in and again in the bigger picture of things who is on the right side who is trying to do the right thing and who is cynically using civilians and civilian infrastructure time and again for their vile purposes we are trying to do the right thing and the next stage of operations will be enhanced operations against Hamas until we will dismantle

the Gaza STP were severely uh destructed and were strike by the Israeli Air Forces without any previous notes or Warnings uh we can say that the majority majority of these buildings were inhabitable it means that 90% of the buildings were full of people and the exact number of death and casualties is not are not yet been known due to the inability of the Medical Teams to reach an access to uh these places as well uh it's important to mention that some towns in the Gaza Strip uh in particular like B hanon town has witnessed a non-stopping bombardment for more than an hour uh no body in the Gaza Strip can know what is the exact number of Destruction and even the uh casualties Raid inside the town of B hanu uh due to the inability to access or to reach the city the majority of its roads were completely destroyed and even it's full of a drones that are from time to another are targeting and attacking different buildings in the city as I've mentioned before in previous coverages like the Israeli Army right now is adopting and and applying the principle of fire belt in which they are trying to walk according to the principle of burned land inside the Gaza Strip as a facilitation to the Israeli uh ground Invasion as you can clearly hear in the background now the sound of bombardments and the Gaza Strip continue without stopping the Gaza Strip sky is full of Israeli fighter jets and Israeli drones that Target uh the Gaza Strip from time to another now in retaliation to these these ongoing attacks the uh Palestinian militants launch barrages of rockets start the Israeli uh

care of them right now the majority of displaced people they tend to United Nations Affiliated schools where they received medical uh treatment and even humanitarian AIDS in order to survive as well it's worth mentioning that the majority of those people received warnings to evacuate the houses because the majority of the house are adjacent to the borders and the majority of Eastern uh towns and

is reported to have been killed so far the town of ashalon has seen major explosions details of Palestinian incursions are unclear but gunmen have been reported in towns near the Gaza border and Israel have been sorry Israel have Israelis have been warned to stay inside Hammer military commander Muhammad de announced the start of the operation in a broadcast pass on Hamas media calling on Palestinians everywhere to fight Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is holding an emergency meeting and the military says is striking Targets in Gaza in response there are Palestinian reports of Israeli soldiers being captured let me bring you these latest pictures from Gaza they're showing Hamas militant celebrating and posing for pictures on what is said to be an Israeli army tank Palestinian media are reporting that a number of Israelis have been taken captive by Fighters the footage also shows what appears to be an an Israeli military vehicle captured by the militants our Middle East correspondent Jan now is in Jerusalem and told us the size of the attacks is unprecedented all my years of covering these rounds of violence we haven't seen an infiltration um on on this scale um really it does seem from the the videos that are circulating that there are perhaps dozens of militants who have crossed uh from the Gaza Strip into Southern Israel you've got unverified TV images that show them on motorbikes um in pickup trucks even by H glider um now unconfirmed reports uh from Gaza also saying that Israelis had taken back into the Palestinian Enclave um some Israelis holding them captured perhaps several soldiers we're not able to to verify that at the moment but that would be a very worrying development indeed for Israelis that brings back uh memories of what happened to gillad Shalit the soldier who was captured in a crossborder raid by Hamas militants back in 2006 and was held until 2011 um now all of this looks extremely well planned um by hamas's milit military Wing um now you can see in some of the videos that there are um militants now who are um filming themselves close to Israeli homes that they may have taken some of those homes over there are also videos filmed by Israelis where you can see um people are in the street shooting and and these people say they can hear Arabic outside their windows that was your land now in Jerusalem well for more on this Let's cross live now to the BBC's International editor Jeremy Bowen who's currently live in Kiev in Ukraine Jeremy you've covered this story the conflict between Israel and Gaza for many years just how significant are today's events this is extremely significant in all the years that Hamas have been in control of Gaza more than 15 they have never done anything like this they have never launched a surprise attack uh on a number of different locations Israeli security officials said an hour or so ago that there were 21 separate incidents going on there's a lot of video circulating not yet verified by the BBC showing uh bodies of Israeli soldiers uh some of whom were clearly surprised uh in their bunks even by the attackers uh no one was expecting Hamas to do anything like this tension has been rising very strongly between pal Ians and Israelis there's been a lot of violence in the West Bank which is the territory that goes from Jerusalem towards the Jordan River uh which been occupied by Israel since 1967 uh that has been the focus now for months and months and there's been a a lot of killing and violence there but nothing in comparison out of Gaza so I think now the Israelis are using very strong language they say they're in a state of War they've been attacked they've pulled up reservists they're having this emergency meeting of their security cabinet and I think it is highly likely that once the Israelis um make their plans that they will probably mount an incursion into Gaza uh this thing is likely to escalate and Jeremy the big question for our viewers will be why now because this seems to be a coordinate coordinated attack that would have taken a lot of planning as well why do you think Hamas is doing today well uh they've called it something like operation Jerusalem flood uh there's been tension in Jerusalem during the recent Jewish holiday nothing on the scale that we've seen before where there were Palestinians being pushed out by force out of the the mosque there the alaxa mosque which is the third holiest site in the world for Muslims and it's also uh for for Jews the site of the Jewish the ancient Jewish temple and therefore venerated by them it's the most single contested piece of ground really in the entire Middle East and uh there have been some incidents there Jews have been praying on the what they know as the Temple Mount which is something which is it doesn't sound much but it's considered to be highly inflammatory and I think it comes as a culmination of these growing months and tension uh between Palestinians and Israelis in Jerusalem in the West Bank and now Hamas have decided to move there's also symbolic anniversary and in the Middle East anniversaries are quite a big deal it's the 50th Anniversary at the moment of the surprise attack in 1973 by Syria and Egypt which lasted which resulted in a Middle East War lasting uh almost a month uh where Israel was it was a close-run thing um and Israelis I've spoken to today are calling this prime minister netanyahu's yum kipor surprise when Israel was taken by surprise 50 years ago and you know it could well be that the Hamas planners thought let's try and do something like that again thank you very much that's our International editor Jeremy Bowen and we look forward to speaking to you throughout the day here on BBC News"},

very sad you know you're watching Al jazer we break into programming to bring you some breaking news we're hearing from American Media uh who are now reporting that the US has started retaliatory strikes for the deaths of three soldiers that took place in Jordan uh earlier this week in fact on Sunday so what we know so far is that there are reports that the US is bombing parts of Eastern Syria uh let's bring in Z joining us from Lebanon in Beirut with more on this developing story Zena what are you hearing about what's going on in eastern Syria we understand well what you mentioned the American Media report that the retaliation the the US retaliation for the killing of the soldiers begun but there's still no confirmation from the Pentagon what we have been hearing from uh sources on the ground really are conflicting reports uh uh mentioning air strikes a series of air strikes now dour it wouldn't be surprising because dour this is in the east of it borders Iraq can this this province is considered to be a stronghold groups that are B by Iran they control the Border cross Syria and Iraq a very location so if these go after these groups then definitely their aour will be among the targets so conflicting reports now what we understand um you know for for for the this wouldn't be really the first time if indeed this this is the US military carrying out carrying out these strikes uh targeting this area in fact since the Gaza the war on Gaza since um Iranian back groups started to Target US troops in Syria and Iraq there have been um you know retaliatory strikes by by the US military in this area but but the biggest question right now is whether or not indeed if this is uh the US to the killing of the will be will this be enough to deter these groups who have said that they will not stop targeting American troops um despite the eminent retaliation for the time being we are hearing reports of air strikes in E Syria uh an area where Iranian back groups Iranian personnel as well Iranian faciliity they're all based in this area that border region but still no information from the okay Zena we'll let you go for now uh we'll come back to you a little bit later we do apologize for the connection uh the audio issues we were having with Zena but we'll bring in um Al jaaz senior political analyst mwan bishara to weigh in on all of this so mwan um as Zena was just saying look we still haven't had confirmation from the Pentagon that this indeed is the us but this is what American Media is reporting right now that air strikes have taken place in particular for what we know so far is in data Zur in eastern Syria your thoughts on this well I tell you I think it's expected right uh regardless of uh of our uh attempts at scratching our heads the past half an hour just trying to figure out who's who uh who's responsible for the bombing where the bombing are taking place why uh certain American sources deny it and others confirm it and so on so forth but if you look at the uh literature and the Declarations statements and everything else been coming out the past five or six days clearly the Biden Administration have made its decision to retaliate to the attack on Northern Jordan and it clearly had a number of potential targets uh the Republicans in Washington have encouraged the Biden Administration to bomb Iran proper Biden said that I don't want a war with Iran and the administration was presumably looking for alternative uh options other than bombing Iran itself so so you can say that it had four options option number one is to bomb the Iranian military targets conventional military targets even nuclear installation so on so forth it discounted that the other option was to bomb the the Iranian revolutionary guard bases clearly it discounted that option as well uh there was a there was a challenge that whether it will bomb those Iranian Republicans guards and it will be faced with the their defenses and apparently they didn't really go for that option and the third option was to bomb kah's or the Hezbollah brigades bases in Iraq for the time being we we don't hear of reports of any bombings within Iraq so in fact if if big if if those reports are correct Washington or the Biden Administration has chosen the lwh hanging Target the lwh hanging fruit among all of that and CH the target is in the failed state of Syria so what would be the the aim of that then so according to reports that uh that looked at what are the value for some of those targets apparently kah in eastern Syria is quite concentrated in it terms of its bases and most important for the American for forces is that that's where they fly out the drones let's remember that the attack at the American base on Northern Jordan or in the Jordan Syrian border was carried out by a drone it was the first time that an American Soldier died by bombing from the air in a number of decades this is a whole new chapter for American strategy and for American defense system and so on so forth so the first Target apparently apparently was the one that was looked at during the week where Wasing were you know various evaluations from Washington were saying that the the most important strategic Target in terms of air retaliation to the attack in Jordan would be to attack the base from which those drones are flown and that is in the eastern uh Border in Syria Marana in the bigger picture and putting this into context does this have the potential to uh to escalate the situation and ignite the region I mean just a few days ago the Secretary of Defense the US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin he said that the US will not tolerate attacks on American troops but at the same time he said this is a dangerous moment in the Middle East exactly I mean you know when you when you listen to what they're saying in Washington they're basically arguing that there's absolutely no way America the world superpower and the Middle East greatest power was not going to retaliate for the killing of three of its soldiers and not just that that this comes after reportedly something between 150 and 160 times where uh American forces in Iraq Syria Yemen and other places or targets have been attacked so it was almost uh you know accepted as a fact that America was going to retaliate anyway so within this condition that America was going to retaliate America apparently chose the most de escalatory escalation so any number of those options I just uh I just uh underlined to you earlier about con whether they will attack conventional forces in Iran Iran Republican guards or Iranian supported groups in Iraq it actually chose not to attack any one of them for the time being they chose as I said the lwh hanging uh Targets in Syria a failed State basically where America could function it actually already has bases there and it doesn't feel that it would upset or doesn't care if it upsets the regime as it would if it upset the presidency in Iraq or the regime in Iran in Syria it's a much easier Target for the United States to that now let's all remember that back in 2018 uh Trump or the Trump presidency also chose to bomb within Syria after the chemical attacks back then so Syria is a much easier Target for the United States than Iraq and Iran and clearly they've chosen the place where reportedly that's where kah flew its drone that killed the American soldiers in Iraq now we should remember and remind our viewers around the world is that the Americans have warned once and again the past few days that this is part of longer sustained campaign that this is not a oneoff in fact their retaliation is going to be sustained and in a number of because they claimed that kah itself did not attack just once it in fact attacked a number of times Marone stand by for just a second because we're going to bring in correspondent Roslin Jordan who's joining us from uh the US Ros what are you hearing on your end"}, "1YOITNy57Mc":

sites have been hit unverified videos are circulating on social media appear to show a weapons Depot being hit in what's thought to be Iraq the videos also show secondary detonations of missiles flying out of a site that's been struck the United States strike is in response to the killing of three American soldiers in a drone attack on a base in Jordan last week US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby says that the US response will continue so the signal is to the irgc and to these groups uh the attacks have got to stop this wasn't just a message sending routine tonight this was about degrading capabilities taking away capabilities by the irgc and and and the and the militant groups these responses began tonight they're not going to end tonight for more we can now speak to Roger Shanahan he's a military analyst and expert based in Sydney thanks very much for being with us so as we just mentioned us officials saying more than 85 sites were hit what more can you tell us about these strikes well we still working off the information that we been given by the US government but they said as you said 85 targets at seven separate sites so multiple targets at particular facilities and they were designed to Target uh command and control facilities uh logistic support uh elements uh weapon stock poles as you saw in the um uh in the video there and it was notable from the US um announcement that it was designed to minimize possibility of cision Civilian casualties but also what wasn't mentioned in there is is the fact that Jordanian aircraft also uh took part in this uh attack so from what the US has said this is the start of a uh of a campaign of retaliatory strikes and yet we should mention that the United States announced their plans to carry out these strikes ahead of time so just how effective could they be wouldn't you think that um there had been preparations for these us strikes oh without a doubt um but I suppose there's probably two elements to that to start with we have to um evaluate the effectiveness of the US strikes at the end of The Campaign not at the start of it um and it's obviously been telegraphed to some degree uh to minimize the possibility of uh civilian but probably senior Iranian uh casualties as well um so there was and the other the third element is there might be also Al other parts of the uh response non-kinetic elements that uh were not pry to that might have been targeting other elements so I think we'll have to wait for a little while until we evaluate how effective they are in totality and not just based on the first night's response well it appears that at least one of the main targets was the alud force of the Iranian revolutionary guard why was this group a Target well the group that's claimed responsibility for the attack that killed the three US service Personnel um uh with the Islamic uh Army in Iraq uh resistance in Iraq um which is an umbrella organization that includes a number of uh Shia militia groups uh who are supported logistically in terms of training and financially by uh Iran and in particular um the IC KS Force which is the overseas um uh wing of the uh revolutionary guard core and so that's why these targets were selected Washington has been quite careful in uh its justification for selecting targets to make sure there's a causal link between uh the attack that occurred in Jordan and the targets that they're selecting so that's why these particular targets have been chosen in the first instance you mentioned that this is only the beginning of the US response and yet uh the US government says it does not want a a war with Iran but how real is the threat of a serious escalation yeah listen I mean that's a good question and it it's a very difficult uh policy line to hold for Washington you're going to have a campaign of responses that are targeting um uh Iranian Affiliated organizations in Syria Syria and Iraq to other countries um and hoping that by um ring fencing your response geographically that you're not going to trigger a direct response from Iran which is why there's not going to be any kinetic strikes in Iran uh so they don't want to Warden uh widen the conflict but Iran itself would have understood that uh the deaths of three US service Personnel from this kind of attack can't go unanswered so it's a very delicate dance that Washington is playing here trying to have a substantive um multi-level multi-day response uh against Iranian interests Iranian backed groups in the region without triggering uh a wider response particularly from Iran but from other groups as well it's it's a difficult uh policy outcome to achieve simultaneously that was Roger Shanahan military analyst and expert joining us from Sydney thanks so much for for

countries are trying to find an illusive ceasefire one man is standing in the way Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu he has gone back fully on Palestinian statehood a goal which many of his allies say may be politically smart for his domestic audience but it will not play well with his International Partners like the United States and Gulf Arab countries with whom he's trying to normalize St in Gaza Netanyahu is leading a military campaign to defeat Hamas and free the remaining 100 odd Israeli hostages who were captured during the October 7th attack at home he's fighting to keep his extreme right-wing Coalition secure and Clinging On to Power by a thread it has got to a point where both goals are now becoming contradictory and on both fronts Netanyahu is struggling on krux decode Can Benjamin Netanyahu survive this war and eat his political cake [Music] to in Gaza more than a 100 hostages still remain captive despite more than 3 months of war and protracted negotiations to try and release them Hamas is battered but they have not been defeated more than 25,000 gazin have been killed but the war remains inconclusive right now it is deadlocked in Israel polls show the Prime Minister would easily lose an election if one were to be held today Netanyahu is becoming a political liability not just for his own party but his extreme right-wing allies who are keeping him in power it's a clash of interests between what will keep him politically alive at the same time not isolating him internationally to retain power and preserve his right-wing Coalition he must reject the idea of a Palestinian state but that is unacceptable to America and to much of the Arab world and to burnish his legacy Netanyahu is also pushing for a landmarked peace deal with Saudi Arabia that is a long-term strategic goal for Israel Saudi Arabia though will not agree to normalizing ties without an explicit Israeli commitment to two-state solution and without Saudi Arabia there will not be a genuine post-war recovery in Gaza but Netanyahu is known to be a political Survivor Israel's longest serving prime minister he's often described as a political magician who is able to alter his fortunes even if that would have mean adopting new positions which are completely contradictory to his old positions given his long history of political survival both his allies and and his critics say it is too early to predict the premature collapse of his government before its tenure formally completes in 2026 it might be too early to write BB's political orbitary just yet as opposition leader back in 1996 he trailed by as much as 20 points in the polls and he looks certain to lose in a general election then he waged a campaign against the Oslo Peace Accords it worked Within 6 months he was elected prime minister but once he assumed office Netanyahu then reluctantly went along with parts of the oso ACC cord he even conceded some territory to the Palestinians in 2017 when he was being investigated on corruption charges and later put on trial many said this is it this is BB's political demise that case is still going on a good 5 years later and despite losing many of his allies parts of his political base he has still managed to win four out of the next five elections even after effectively suspending the peace process with the Palestinians he sealed landmarked diplomatic deals in 2020 with as many as four Arab countries which had shunned Israel on the Palestinian issue that includes Bahrain the UAE Morocco and Sudan but the war in Gaza has complicated things for the Prime Minister there is no end to this war which can keep BB relevant both at home and abroad in Gaza netanyahu's two main objectives are mutually incompatible defeating Hamas would most likely cost the lives of many hostages who are still in captivity alternatively a diplomatic deal to free the hostages would most likely leave Hamas in charge of Gaza either outcome is not going to be good for Netanyahu earlier this week itamar benir who is netanyahu's far-right Coalition partner threatened to quit the government if Netanyahu negotiated a deal with Hamas in which hostages were freed but Hamas retained control of Gaza should Netanyahu lose the support of the far right then he could partner with Centrist leaders like former Army Chief Benny Gans or the opposition leader Yar lapid both of them have offered to support a hostage deal and put an end to this war an alliance with Centrist parties would also give Netanyahu the political cover to allow the Palestinian Authority which which currently runs the Israeli occupied West Bank to govern Gaza as well and that would be a big win because that would again delegitimize Hamas and its control of Gaza but several allies and analysts have said that such a move if Netanyahu would to accept it would anger his right-wing base much of his base wants Jewish Israelis to resettle in Gaza and that would give right-wing Rivals like benir a boost in the elections since the October 7th attack popular support for a two-state solution has dwindled if an election is called nathany who wants to Center The Campaign on a singular question of Palestinian statehood the Israeli Prime Minister thinks he can recover some of the Lost votes by presenting himself as the only leader who can stand up to both American and Arab pressure to try and call for a Palestinian State he also feels particularly after the October 7th attack fact that there is a majority of Israelis who feel the same way that BB Netanyahu is the best bet for an anti-2 State solution netanyahu's public rejection of Palestinian sovereignty is at odds with what his onvo are currently discussing with both the United States and Saudi Arabia these conversations are happening back Channel right now Netanyahu thinks he can walk the political tight rope persuading Saudi Arabia to normalize ties with Israel in exchange he would agree to a nominal plan which would give some kind of cursory statehood to Palestine Netanyahu ever the political Survivor is banking on this double game he says to his own constituency back home don't worry I will never agree to a Palestinian State and then he says to the US and to Saudi Arabia don't worry we will find a solution but opinion polls since October 7th show that the public has lost faith in Netanyahu just this past week Israel's leading private television station channel 12 published a poll suggesting that less than a quarter of Israelis preferred Netanyahu over Benny Gans who happens to be his main rival can BB Netanyahu the great political Survivor of Israel outlive what could easily be the last fight of his life"}, "JFPi4u7QWpA": {"url":

Ahmed Bah the deputy head of the Palestinian elected Parliament or assembly to be to be fair just one second one second Mr I'm not asking you about what Israel is doing to your people I'm asking you what happened on that day this is UN important this is a bead this is the grand child of Dr Al today please allow me one minute today now we are on the 18th day of this conflict in 17 days Israel in 48 hours killed 1,800 children so every 18 minutes there is a child being killed by Israel this destruction this destruction happened to civilian blocks now half of the Gaza population is homeless than somebody the president of the United States leaders of you but none of that would have happened if you had not attacked the kabut if you had not gone into civilian areas and targeted civilians and taken civilian hostages they are not hostages first secondly I told you whatever you call them captives guests whatever will you let them go what have they done I said we will release them and Alan brigades announced that but now they are distributed in different locations Israel has killed more than 22 of them because of the destruction it has caused so therefore if Netanyahu was keen on their safety if the Europeans and the Americans are keen on their safeties let them Force Israel to stop its aggression to stop this genocide this brutal war crimes which are committed every day yesterday only 400 victims in one night Dominic let them stop this aggression and you will find the mediators like Qatar and some Arab countries like Egypt and others they'll find a way to have them release and we'll send them to their H did you mean to take civilian hostages did you intend to do that or was that a mistake taking so many civilians and civilians from countries all around the world I said this happened within the situation of a battle Assam Fighters focused on the army officers and rank and file to exchange them for the 5,500 prisoners we have we have hundreds of children women we have some people who spend 45 years in Israeli presence Dominic please try and understand me this is a message H this is not this is not a battle between Israel and Hamas this is a attle between Israel as an occupier and the palestini people not asking about that I'm asking about the hostages I'm asking about your captives Mr Michelle please dominate please Western media talk talks about being objective but you have to apply them honestly like you apply them to Rwanda genocide was there Netanyahu is committing genocide our cause is a cause of Liberation you do not look at the latest developments you tend conveniently to forget the crimes upon which Israel was founded in 1948 the Palestinian people want freedom negotiated with them he made peace with them they poisoned him they killed him Abu is left helpless I don't want so all of that justifies what you did on October 7th going into civilian places taking civilians hostage killing civilians taking old women taking children all that all of that is justified by what Israel did is that right you're saying an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth did two wrongs make a right you Dominic insist on the same narrative this is what Israel has done occupation assaults on Al assaults on children Massac this is what made them fight their soldiers as I told are Fighters but they are killers but on that day we saw your Fighters killing women killing children taking children taking old women are you saying let me ask you was that was that a mistake did you go too far you couldn't control your Fighters because you talked about the military operation the attacks on the civilians the 250 dead at that music festival they were attacked deliberately by fighters in paragliders we've seen the pictures was that intentional or was that a mistake because you say you were only attack attacking the military but clearly many civilians were targeted killed kidnapped and tortured that day Dominic please listen to me well the elite forces of Hamas on the dawn of 7th of October attacked the bares and positions of the Gaza division defeated them in seven they went to other we've heard about the military we heard I'm ask you about the civilians the attacks on the civilians please answer that Mr M never Dominic you insist on adopting the Israeli narrative it's not Israeli it's it's the pictures we've seen on Al jaaz Palestinian journalists have filmed Hamas Fighters going to civilian places attacking civilians I'm asking you please answer was that intended was it calculated or was it a mistake did your men go too far that day I'm telling you very specifically the elite forces of Alan did not kill civilians with the admission of Israeli women in Israeli media as a result of the fire exchange and by the bullets of why are they in kutes Hamas bandanas they're in kutes civilian places looking for civilians let me finish my sentence please if there was any killing this definitely was not intended definitely you seem to forget on this and focus on this and get more than 5,000 Palestinian martys in 17 days more than 1,800 children is it really reasonable that the Western mind which always talks about equality Justice objectivity human rights please allow me to continue see only these partial details and forget about the big picture I ask you a question Netanyahu failed militarily on the 7th of October one huge division Was Defeated what what did Nyah do in 17 days he kills Palestinians in Gaza Scotch land policies he is doing nothing but Revenge how many military targets did they achieve nany in 17 days why the world why Biden let me tell you let me tell you please every leader American or Western who came to Tel Aviv during the war to support Israeli crimes and conveniently ignores these crimes on Gaza and only cries for Israel they have no no ethic so you said the killing of civilians was not intended but they went to rim they went to this music festival a civilian place it's not a military place at all they killed 250 people they dragged people out of their cars they killed them in their cars we we've seen the video evidence uh they slaughtered people they were running away in the hundreds away from the gunmen that was all not intentional that was a just a mistake and how did you feel when you watched that your own fighters your own people doing that to innocent civilians were you ashamed no I feel proud that our Palestinian people for 75 years under Israeli occupation did not surrender did not raise the white flag and still fighting Israel and allow me to speak please that Britain us the countries who founded Israel and still supported in this crime should feel ashamed when they see 1,800 children 5,000 Ms in 17 days and they still being hypocritical and using double standards so you were proud that day Mr Michelle I don't want to see any more pictures of what Israel's doing I'm asking what you did to Israel you felt proud that day to watch Palestinian government killing innocent people with no weapons just there to celebrate music did you you I want to clarify this you felt proud your emotion on October 7th was Pride was it revenge or Pride or did you feel a bit of pity for those poor Israeli civilians being killed defenseless civilians being killed in Cold Blood you Dominic you go against the public opinion in Britain this is an opinion poll in UK on the 19th of October 58% support a ceas fire 18% 7 6 in total three quarters of the British public opinion support a ceas fire why this means they did not adopt the Israeli narrative which was proven to be false Biden himself admitted that the beheadings did not take place so if the British public opinion Sayes that the war should be stopped because it does not what is why are you for 15 minutes still asking the same questions I'm sure the Israeli presenter if he was to discuss who discussed this with me he would have listened to what the Israeli are saying that the Israeli police and Israeli Army killed the civilians also in Britain there are families sitting uh waiting desperately for news about their their loved ones and people around the world what is your message to them can you say anything to make them feel better I told you I said this are civilians who are in Gaza they are our guest we are eager to release them all what is required is prepare the right conditions to move them from where they are so that they are not killed by Israeli bombardment Dominic what Israel has thrown by way of bombs on Gaza is the equivalent of what was thrown on Afghanistan in 10 years in 17 days this is a crime stop this destruction and the families in America us or everywhere or Thailand or other nationalities they receive their loved ones as you saw the two two american ladies is there any way out you can offer today to Israel to anyone else that can see an end to this or is this just going to go on forever and ever and is it always the other side's fault no no no there is an exit definitely it's the fault of the occupation definitely but the exit can be in two stages first regarding this current conflict this criminal war on Gaza bombardment and aggression on Gaza should stop and Israel should seize forcefully removing the people of Gaza from the northern pass to the seven or to Egypt all Crossing points should be open eight should be allowed to enter the Gaza should be provided with water electricity supplies medical otherwise if this happened and there's a ceasefire we will come back to the big question what was the root cause of what happened we will say it's the occupation so Israel should withdraw from the occupied land then we'll have a window of opportunity and the real opportunity apart from that if our people remain under occupation led by Netanyahu destroying everything for expelling people killing and Ming this is not accept Dominic this is in brief this solution this is very simple this is logical this is rational we want to live without occupation this is normal natural and reason anybody in any continent will not accept living under occupation these are natural feelings we you do not need to teach a child how they should love their home or live in Liberty and dignity this is part and parcel of being a human being our people loves we we hate aggression but do not accept it against us"}, "8Cwi_DhKWwg": {"url":

CHARLIE, GOOD TO SEE YOU.  I WAS STANDING WHERE YOU WERE  RECENTLY AND THINGS ARE  CHANGING FROM MINUTE TO MINUTE.  WHERE ARE THEY NOW, THE  OPERATIONS WITHIN GAZA?  >> Reporter: YEAH, TONY.  WE FIRST GOT THE INFORMATION  FROM THE IDF THEMSELVES WHO SAY  THEY ARE ADVANCING KILOMETERS AT A TIME AND THAT WAS A BRIEF WE  GOT THIS MORNING.  THERE ARE ESSENTIALLY TWO  FRONTS IN THE GAZA STRIP.  AS YOU KNOW, IT IS ONLY SEVEN  MILES AT ITS WIDEST.  WE GOT VIDEO THAT WE ARE TRYING  O VERIFY IF IT IS LEGIT OF  TANKS APPROACHING GAZA CITY.  GAZA CITY IS MASSIVE AND IT  STRETCHES TO THE GAZA BORDER  ALREADY. WE'VE BEEN DOWN TO THE  BORDER AND IT IS NOISY.  A LOT OF OUTGOING ARTILLERY,  BUT NOT NEARLY THE INTENSITY WE  WITNESSED 48 HOURS AGO.  WE SAW HUGE AIRSTRIKES OFF IN  THE DISTANCE.  IN FACT, WE WENT TO AN APARTMENT THAT HAD ACTUALLY BEEN HIT THIS  MORNING.  EVEN THOUGH HAMAS HAS PINNED IT  DOWN, THEY ARE MANAGING TO FIRE  THESE ROCKETS AND ISRAELI  DEFENSE FORCES SAY AS LONG AS  THIS CONTINUES, HAMAS REMAINS A  THREAT.  THEY ARE MAKING ADVANCES BUT  HAMAS IS CAPABLE OF FIRING BACK  IF AND WHEN THEY CAN.  >> CHARLIE, FOR MOST OF THE  WEEKEND, GAZA WAS WITHOUT  COMMUNICATION ON TOP OF THE  ESCALATING HUMANITARIAN CRISIS,  THE NEED FOR ALL KINDS OF  ESSENTIAL AID, WATER,  ELECTRICITY, FOOD. TALK TO US  ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE  BLACKOUT OF COMMUNICATION ON  TOP OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN  GAZA.  >> Reporter: YEAH, LILIA.   IT HASN'T REALLY BEEN REPORTED  OR CONFIRMED AS TO WHETHER THIS  IS AN INTENTIONAL THING BY  ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES OR A  CONSEQUENCE AND A RESULT OF THE  MASS BOMBARDMENT THAT TOOK  PLACE ON FRIDAY NIGHT, EARLY  SATURDAY MORNING.  AID AGENCIES AND THE U.N. SAID  ALL YOU'VE DONE IS PUT A  BLACKOUT WHERE WE NEED TO  COMMUNICATE WITH OUR PEOPLE  INSIDE GAZA AND THAT IS THE  SAME FOR US.  YOU KNOW, MARWAN, OUR PRODUCER,  WENT  BLACK ON US TOO.  AID AGENCIES ARE TRYING TO  COMMUNICATE AND WE ALL KNOW AS  WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING FOR THE  LAST FEW WEEKS HOW DIRE THE  SITUATION IS THERE.  IT WAS NOT ONLY A BLACKOUT OF  COMMUNICATION, PEOPLE TRYING TO  COMMUNICATE WITHIN GAZA ITSELF,  BUT WITHIN THE GAZA TERRITORY,  PEOPLE COMMUNICATING WITH ONE  ANOTHER.  ISRAELIS HAVE BEEN DROPPING  LEAFLETS TELLING PEOPLE TO MOVE  FROM NORTH TO SOUTH BUT WHEN  YOU HAVE FUEL DEFICIENCIES AND  A COMMUNICATION BLACKOUT, IT  MAKES IT DIFFICULT AND  DANGEROUS FOR ANYONE LEFT IN  NORTHERN PARTS OF GAZA TO MOVE  TO THE SOUTH WHERE WE CAN  REPORT WITH CONFIDENCE THOSE  AREAS ARE BEING BOMBARDED.  >> CHARLIE, THE POLITICS OF  ISRAEL COULD HAVE A BIG IMPACT  ON HOW THIS WAR IS PURSUED.  IT IS WITH THAT IN MIND I ASK  YOU ABOUT THE VIDEO HAMAS HAS  RELEASED SHOWING THREE HOSTAGES  BLAMING PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN  NETANYAHU FOR THE WAR IN GAZA.  I HAVE NOT SEEN THE VIDEO  MYSELF.  WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT IT?  >> Reporter: TONY, AS YOU ARE  WELL AWARE, WE HAVE TO BE WEARY  OF A VIDEO LIKE THIS.  PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN  NETANYAHU SAID THIS WAS A CRUEL  USE OF PROPAGANDA. WE HAVE TO  BE CAREFUL WHAT WE HAVE SEEN  AND WHAT WE CAN REPORT BECAUSE  WE HAVE TO ASSUME THE THREE  ISRAELI HOSTAGES WERE UNDER  DURESS.  AS YOU SAID, DEEPLY POLITICAL -- CRITICAL OF THE PRIME MINISTER.  THEY WENT ON TO SUGGEST A DEAL  WAS MADE.  AGAIN, THIS IS PROBABLY DONE  UNDER DURESS. YOU CAN SEE AFTER  23, 24 DAYS OF CAPTIVITY, YOU  CAN SEE THE STRAIN ON THEIR  FACES.  IT IS TOUGH TO WATCH AND TOUGH  TO REPORT ON. WE HAVE TO DECIDE  HOW TO USE IT BEST.  WE DON'T WANT TO FOLLOW  PROPAGANDA, BUT THE BOTTOM LINE  OR THE TOP LINE, I GUESS, THE  BLAME IS ON THE ISRAELI  GOVERNMENT AND I MERRILY PRIME  MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU  SUGGESTING A HOSTAGE DEAL, A  PRISONER SWAP COULD BE UNDERWAY  BUT THE ISRAELIGOVERNMENT PUT  THE BRAKES ON IT.  OF COURSE, THIS IS WHAT HAMAS  HAS BEEN SAYING FOR WEEKS.  WE ARE WILLING TO TRADE  HOSTAGES OR ELSE THEY WILL BE  IN DANGER.  >> CHARLIE, WE REALLY  APPRECIATE YOUR WORK THERE.  HAVE A GOOD EVENING, AND A SAFE  ONE.  >>> PRESIDENT BIDEN SPOKE WITH  PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU  YESTERDAY AND URGED HIM TO  INCREASE HUMANITARIAN FLOW OF  AID INTO GAZA.  >> NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL  COORDINATOR JOHN KIRBY SPOKE TO  ME EARLIER ON CBS MORNINGS  ABOUT THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S RESPONSE.  >> WE ARE NOT EVALUATING EACH  AND EVERY STRIKE THEY TAKE AND  WE WILL NOT REACT IN REAL-TIME  TO EACH AND EVERY OPERATION  THEY CONDUCT.  WE HAVE BEEN IN CONSTANT  COMMUNICATION WITH THE  ISRAELIS, INCLUDING OVER THE  WEEKEND AS YOU NOTED FROM THE  PRESIDENT AND HIS MEETING WITH  PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN  NETANYAHU TO RESPECT THE LAW OF  WAR AND MINIMIZE CASUALTIES.  >> FOR MORE, BO ERICKSON JOINED  IS NOW.  COMMUNICATIONS IN GAZA WERE  PARTIALLY RESTORED FOLLOWING  PRESIDENT BIDEN'S CALL WITH THE  ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER.  THE LACK OF COMMUNICATION WAS  IMPACTING THE FLOW OF AID INTO  GAZA.  WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THOSE  TALKS?  DOES BIDEN HAVE SOMETHING TO DO  WITH THE RESTORING OF  COMMUNICATIONS?  >> Reporter: PRESIDENT BIDEN  HAS SPOKEN SEVERAL TIMES WITH  PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN  NETANYAHU AND IN EACH ONE OF  THESE PHONE CALLS, PRESIDENT  BIDEN REITERATED ISRAEL HAS THE  RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF BUT THEY  HAVE BEEN MORE OUTSPOKEN AT THE  WHITE HOUSE THAT THE RIGHT TO  DEFEND THEMSELVES, WITH THE  REQUIREMENTS THE OPERATION HAS  TO BE CONSISTENT WITH  INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW  AND HERE IN WASHINGTON,  PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS BEEN FACING  CRITICISM FROM WITHIN HIS OWN  PARTY TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE  FIRM WITH WHAT THAT MEANS WHEN  IT COMES TO HIS CONVERSATIONS  WITH NETANYAHU.  SEVERAL CENTERS INCLUDING   ELIZABETH WARREN, SEVERAL  OTHERS IN THE COUNTRY WHO WERE  CALLING FOR HUMANITARIAN PAUSE.  INTERN TRYING TO PUSH THE U.S.  TO TRY TO ADVOCATE FOR THAT.  THERE WAS A PHONE CALL THIS  WEEKEND AND THE PRESIDENT DID  MAKE THIS CALL.  IT SEEMS THERE WERE SOME  COMMUNICATIONS THERE.  THERE WAS INDICATION THERE IS  MORE AID FLOWING BECAUSE THE  INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS AND  RELIEF ORGANIZATIONS SAID THEY  WERE ABLE TO GET IN THREE  HUMANITARIAN AID TRUCKS INTO  GAZA.  AS WE ALL KNOW, THREE TRUCKS  WILL NOT BE ENOUGH.   >> YOU KNOW, BO, THE UNITED  STATES  CONDITIONS AID TO ANY  COUNTRY.  MILITARY WEAPONS AS WELL. THE  USE OF THOSE WEAPONS ARE IN  ACCORDANCE TO NATIONAL LAW. I  WAS CURIOUS TO ASK JOHN KIRBY  IF WHETHER THE U.S. WAS  COMFORTABLE WITH THE WAY ISRAEL  WAS ATTACKING TARGETS IN GAZA.  HE SAID QUITE OPENLY THEY ARE  NOT REVIEWING EACH AND EVERY  STRIKE, WHICH I THINK SURPRISED  ME A LITTLE BIT PARTICULARLY  SINCE WE HEARD FROM THE BIDEN  ADMINISTRATION AND FROM JOE  BIDEN HIMSELF THAT HE'S TALKING  TO NETANYAHU AND ASKING THE IDF  TO MAKE THIS REALLY STRONG PUSH  TO MINIMIZE CIVILIAN CASUALTIES . DO YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION  AS TO HOW THOSE CONVERSATIONS  ARE GOING BETWEEN BIDEN AND  NETANYAHU ?  >> Reporter: THAT WAS THE KEY  QUESTION TO ASK BECAUSE THE  PRESIDENT AND HIS  ADMINISTRATION HAVE GIVEN A  FULL THROATED ENDORSEMENT OF  BASICALLY WHATEVER ISRAEL WANTS  TO DO. THEY SAID THEY WOULD NOT  DICTATE WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO,  BUT AT THE END OF LAST WEEK WE  HEARD MORE DISTANCE FROM  OFFICIALS AT THE WHITE HOUSE  BEING PLACED BETWEEN THE BIDEN  ADMINISTRATION AND THE EXACT  OPERATIONS OF THE ISRAELI  MILITARY. SPECIFICALLY JOHN  KIRBY SAID ISRAEL HAS TO ANSWER  THE QUESTIONS OF THE SOUNDNESS  OF PLANNING AND THE  EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS EXECUTION.  WHAT THAT TELLS US IS THAT THE  BIDEN ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT  WANT TO HAVE TO ANSWER FOR  EVERYTHING THAT THE ISRAELI  MILITARY DOES, BUT I DON'T KNOW  HOW THAT ARGUMENT WILL STAND  BECAUSE OF ALL THE AID AND  MILITARY AID THE UNITED STATES  IS GIVEN TO THE ISRAELI  MILITARY AS WELL AS THERE IS A  GROWING GROUP OF HOUSE DEMOCRATS DOWN THE STREET CALLING FOR A  COMPLETE CEASE-FIRE SO THERE IS  A POLITICAL ELEMENT AT THE  WHITE HOUSE AND THE PRESIDENT  HAVE TO ADDRESS AS WELL.  >> BO, THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION  HAS BEEN ADDRESSING THE RISING  NUMBER OF  ANTI-SEMITIC  INCIDENTS OCCURRING ON SCHOOLS  AND COLLEGE CAMPUSES.  THERE WAS THE KILLING OF A  YOUNG CHILD IN THIS COUNTRY.  WHAT DO THE EFFORTS FROM THE  WHITE HOUSE LOOK LIKE?  FOR TWO THE WHITE HOUSE HAS  BEEN FOCUSED ON THE LARGER  SCALE OPERATIONS IN ISRAEL BUT  AS WE HAVE SEEN THESE INSTANCES  AND CLASHES ON THE COLLEGE  CAMPUS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY  HAVE BEEN REALLY BOILING, SO  THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS THEY ARE  ALARMED AT THE ANTI-SEMITIC  INCIDENTS ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES  THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND THIS  MORNING THEY ANNOUNCED THE  ADMINISTRATION AND THE  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY  HAS BEEN BRIEFING COLLEGE  CAMPUSES, SPECIFICALLY THE LAW  ENFORCEMENT DIVISIONS, ON HOW  TO DEAL WITH THESE INCIDENTS \u00faA  TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER SOME  PROCESS THAT STUDENTS WILL BE  ABLE TO FILE FEDERAL"}, "p8Hiy-VxkLs": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8Hiy-VxkLs", "video_id": "p8Hiy-VxkLs", "description": "The Hamas military group claims it has taken Israelis as hostages back into the Gaza Strip during its surprise attack on Israel.

CROSSING OVER THE BORDER INTO ISRAEL. AS WE SPEAK, PALESTINIAN GUNMEN ARE INSIDE ISRAELI TOWNS, CITIES, AND POTENTIALLY MILITARY BASES IN THE SOUTH OF ISRAEL. THEY ARE FIGHTING RUNNING GUN BATTLES AGAINST ISRAELI FORCES ON A SCALE THAT WE HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. AS YOU SAID, THESE PALESTINIAN MILITANTS CROSSING OVER BY LAND, BY SEA, AND BY AIR. WHEN WE SAY BY AIR, THEY FLEW OVER THE GAZA BORDER IN PARAGLIDERS. AGAIN, SOMETHING ISRAEL HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE. MOST ALARMINGLY, THE HAMAS MILITANT GROUP WHICH CONTROLS GAZA SAYS IT HAS TAKEN ISRAELIS HOSTAGE. IT HAS TAKEN THEM INSIDE OF THE GAZA STRIP. NOW, ISRAEL AS A GOVERNMENT, AS A PEOPLE, AS A NATION, WILL GO TO ALMOST ANY LENGTHS TO GET ITS PEOPLES BACK, WHETHER THEY ARE ALIVE OR DEAD. IF IT IS THE CASE THAT THERE ARE ISRAELIS BEING HELD INSIDE OF GAZA, THE GOVERNMENT AND PRIME MINISTER, BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, MAY FEEL THAT HE HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO LAUNCH A LARGE-SCALE GROUND OFFENSIVE INTO THE GAZA STRIP TO GET THOSE PEOPLE BACK. ON THE NUMBERS, KATIE, THE ISRAELI EMERGENCY SERVICES, SOME OF WHOM YOU CAN SEE BEHIND ME, SAY THAT 22 ISRAELIS ARE CONFIRMED DEAD. I CAN TELL YOU, BASED ON THESE TRULY HARROWING VIDEOS THAT WE ARE SEEING ON SOCIAL MEDIA, WHICH APPEAR TO SHOW THE BODIES OF BOTH ISRAELI SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS, EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY IS BRACING FOR A DEATH ARRIVING HIGHER STILL. HE MAY BE ABLE TO SEE, KATIE, A GROUP OF ISRAELI POLICE, SPECIAL FORCES, APPEAR TO BE GOING PAST US HERE ON MOTORCYCLES. THEY ARE HEADING SOUTH TO WHERE THESE GONE BATTLES ARE CONTINUING, BETWEEN PALESTINIAN GUNMEN AND ISRAELI FORCES. THIS IS, NORMALLY, ONE OF THE BUSIEST HIGHWAYS AND SOUTHERN ISRAEL. YOU CAN SEE RIGHT NOW IT HAS BEEN CLOSED BY ISRAELI SECURITY FORCES. THEY ARE CHECKING EVERY SINGLE CAR THAT IS COMING FROM THE SOUTH TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NOT MORE PALESTINIAN GUNMEN INSIDE TRYING TO HEAD NORTH UP TO TEL AVIV, TOWARDS JERUSALEM, TOWARDS THE NORTHEAST. EVERY FEW MINUTES WE ARE SEEING MORE ISRAELI REINFORCEMENTS HEADING SOUTH IN THE FORM OF SPECIAL FORCES. WE HAVE SEEN TRUCKS CARRYING MORE OF THESE IRON DOME MISSILE INTERCEPTORS DRIVING SOUTH, TRYING TO STOP WHAT HAS BEEN A BARRAGE OF MORE THAN 2000 ROCKETS FIRED OVER THE COURSE OF THE DAY. THESE ROCKETS HAVE BEEN DEADLY, IN AND OF THEMSELVES. WE HAVE SEEN PILLARS OF SMOKE FROM ISRAELI TOWNS, CITIES, ALL ACROSS THE SOUTH OF ISRAEL. THE ROCKETS APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN, ESSENTIALLY, AIR COVER FOR THIS GROUND OFFENSIVE. KATIE, I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH AN ISRAELI OFFICIAL. BASED ON WHAT HE IS SEEING, THE SCALE OF THE FIGHTING THERE ARE, AT MINIMUM, HUNDREDS OF PALESTINIAN GUNMAN INVOLVED IN THIS ATTACK. HE SAYS THE CORRECT WORD TO USE RIGHT NOW IS INVASION. ISRAEL HAS NOT BEEN CAUGHT OFF GUARD LIKE THIS SINCE OCTOBER OF 1973. EXACTLY 50 YEARS AGO. WE ARE, KATIE, JUST SEEING WHAT APPEARED TO BE SOME ROCKETS IN THE SKY BEHIND US. THE ROCKETS ARE NOT GOING OFF. WE ARE GOOD TO CONTINUE TALKING TO YOU HERE. OUR CAMERA MAN IS POINTING AT THEM HERE TO JETS, MY CAMERA OPERATOR, DAVE COPELAND, IS SAYING THESE APPEAR TO BE ISRAELI AIR FORCE JETS. ALREADY CARRYING OUT STRIKES INSIDE OF GAZA. AND AS YOU SAID, PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU HAS DECLARED\nTHAT ISRAEL IS A NATION AT WAR. THAT ISRAEL IS A NATION AT WAR. in your wallet, right? DECLARE ISRAELI AIRSTRIKES INSIDE OF GAZA HAVE ALREADY BEGUN. I THINK IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT WHAT WE ARE SEEING NOW IS JUST THE BEGINNING IS WHAT WILL ULTIMATELY BE A MUCH, MUCH, LARGER OFFENSIVE. KATIE, JUST FOR A LITTLE HISTORICAL CONTEXT HERE YOU HAVE TO GO BACK EXACTLY 50 YEARS, OCTOBER 6TH 1973 WHEN ISRAEL WAS CAUGHT OFF GUARD BY COMBINED EGYPTIAN, SYRIAN, INVASION. IT IS KNOWN IN THE HISTORY BOOKS AS THE HOME KAPOOR WAR. IT IS AN EVENT WHERE PEOPLE, WHO ARE OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER IT, WE'LL TELL YOU THAT THEY TRULY FEAR THAT ISRAEL WAS GOING TO BE WIPED OFF THE MAP.

Ireland Matthew what extraordinary scenes in this very tragic uh war and conflict over the past seven weeks uh following the hostage taking and and the killing of 1200 Israelis uh and then of course the devastation of Gaza that we saw over the last seven uh weeks with the bombardment and the ground offensive uh with the death toll rising in Gaza finally a moment a glimmer of hope um it was difficult not to get emotional actually when we saw uh that Red Cross Convoy uh with children with the elderly uh come out of Gaza into Egypt yes absolutely good evening the anxiety of course for us was building as we knew that operation was beginning today uh and I saw those pictures and saw colleagues uh taking those four vehicles at Rafa Crossing and and through the border so yes a huge relief that that has happened I can confirm that we had um four vehicles we had eight ICC staff and included in that number was um one doctor and again to confirm 24 hostages were released as part of that Convoy of vehicles and and as you said I was just looking at some of your pictures just now and to see some Smiles well that's quite something after everything it's quite something it truly is and and just seeing some of those Palestinian children as well cheering on that Convoy as it left Gaza really important to see this operation uh begin it's going to be a multi-day operation as has been reported wide widely we expect it to go on for some days and it also includes two other very significant elements um the ISC will also be uh helping to transfer U Palestinian prisons uh prisoners uh to from their places of detention uh to the West Bank and also to get medical supplies into Gaza because this is absolutely critical there is this ceasefire currently ongoing but as I think your viewers know from the recent days and weeks uh the medical situation in apologies a apologies I I just want uh to to just talk over these images because we're seeing very small children babies in the hands of adults getting into a a bus now uh so these are the hostages they've gone through their preliminary medical check is that correct Matthew because if you could just talk over these images uh we're seeing uh some of those uh hostages being uh escorted onto a white bus so they have gone through uh their medical assessment so what I can confirm from from our side from for the Red Cross is that um the 24 hostages were safely uh transferred to the Rafa border crossing and uh then handed over to the Israeli authorities now in a standard operation thec has lots of experience over many many years of this kind of thing the release of of people detained for a variety of reasons uh including hostages um but we would normally where we can make some medical assessments we would obviously check that that the transfer um is something that they um they agree with I think in this case that was that was pretty much guaranteed so we would have done what we can but I think they were with us for a very short period of time inside Gaza and then handed over at that border crossing so what you're seeing now the pictures you're seeing now are uh other medical authorities and doctors nurses being able to check on their welfare and again as you say it's just a relief to be able to see that this is has happened safely and is ongoing uh in indeed and we saw uh among them there small children in the arms of adults uh I spotted a a young girl being taken onto uh that white bus we're looking at aerial Vision there's dozens of ambulances uh lined up there outside that medical facility and as you say uh they clearly went through some medical checks and they're now being taken onto the bus to be transferred and brought uh back home their families are desperately and anxiously waiting for them among them small children we also saw a group of uh I believe Thai Nationals we also know one uh Filipina uh is among them as well is that correct Matthew in terms of the the breakdown of of who was brought out so in terms of Ages and the nationalities that's not something I'm able to confirm I can confirm the the 24 hostages as as you say but again just looking at these pictures now that you're showing uh and and seeing the children uh we have talked so much in recent weeks about the impact of this conflict on children children in Israel and children in Gaza people who have children who have lost their parents um lost their siblings lost their loved ones and and and not knowing what on Earth is going on and I think to be able to see uh this happening right now and know that it's a small number it is a small number but to know that some children tonight um can be back in the arms of their moms and their dads that is really quite significant and we uh continue to call for for more releases um all hostages need to be released um and those that are are held they need to to ICC needs to be given access to to see them and check on their conditions but yes it is some release it's a small number but we hope for more in the coming days uh indeed uh and we are being told uh that uh well the bus is moving now so clearly uh they're on their way back to Israel they're going to leave uh Egypt and make their way back we understand they'll be transported from these buses to helicopters by the IDF uh given noise control headphones and then brought to medical facilities in Israel for further checks"}, "5gMwnjZvhhk": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gMwnjZvhhk", "video_id": "5gMwnjZvhhk", "description": "Qatar is mediating between Israel

news and we're hearing that qter is currently negotiating the release of between 10 and 15 captives being held in Gaza by Hamas in return for a ceasefire that would last for one or two days only four captors have been released so far about 200 people have been held since October the 7th so hearing that kater is currently negotiating release of between 10 and 15 captives let's bring in my jues wiy uh who's here to talk about this director of studies Center the studies Center at K University uh so these negotiations have been going on for some time but this seems to be a new development I think um it was it was announced by um Hamas I think in the first week that or fers they want to release them as early as possible and they consider them guests when uh the appropriate time is there and they wanted to make sure that the roads are safe and there's no bombard on on those people and they want to make sure because those people are not located in one place they are it seems that they are in different place and they want to make sure they are you know and they can move them to the safe place I think this news uh is a greater news I think it comes also after the the the communication which were going on between Washington and T Aviv in the last 48 hours you know the vice president of the United States has have been talken to Netanyahu um Biden as well uh his you know the director of the CIA was in the region a few days ago I think there was a a huge effort by the Americans to uh having breaking through when it comes to the uh hostages I think this um few days ago there was an attempt to release 12 people but there was a complication on Logistics which delayed the whole process if this happens um because Hamas wanted a ceasefire because they wanted to make sure that food um and and need what people need is coming in inside inside coming into the Gaza so I think if this if the hopefully it will go on uh that will be a good start uh to uh you know have a sort of a uh measures that can facilitate releasing more of those foreigners do you think do you think it could come about because Israel of course have said that they they don't want a seesar or a PS of any kind I think I think that's they couldn't continue with this pressure it's obvious um there are three elements now is imposing on on Netanyahu government one is the um international support is actually is weakened because of all of this massacr and number two there is a pressure on the Western Government from their own public opinion and the third reason is uh there is a huge pressure from within Israel for for how long they will do this and now it seems the narrative has been changed they wanted to they start to look about on the hostage Israelis and foreigners now it seems they are dividing you know the military people the Israeli are different story but we need to make sure that foreigners are released as soon as possible captives are a big element in this this whole scenario and some two what two weeks ago I think they were talking about an all for all SWAP for these uh for all the captives in Gaza and potentially Palestinian prisoners in Israel yeah and the and the the question was you know what Israel will will will pay back I mean because that you know Palestinians they have request on the table on the table they say okay we need seiz fire we need we need ra to be open we need to make sure that you know the flood of uh water the of food medicine is going on we need we need the bombard of hospital to be stopped you know they are request from the Palestinian as well and and and I think I think this is an indicator that Israelis has accepted some of this because otherwise we would not have this kind of Step It seems both sides they came to the point that everyone has to give some concession so they make sure that things some relief on the ground but it would seem that the concession in this case would be a ceasefire for one or two days would it be anything more than that do you think think for what are we talk about 10 and 15 capes it's a good start let's let's remember in the first two weeks the discussion was about 2 three hours the discussion was is Cease Fire for two 3 hours 4 hours 6 hours now we talk about 48 hours and that's itself a good achievement taking into consideration the radical positions of Netanyahu government what about the negotiating team itself I mean Kat heavily involved in all absolutely no doubt that qar has a credibility when it comes to the issue of mediation that Americans trusted them they have made many many statements uh showing the trust of the Qatari efforts um and also uh Qatar said that you know they have the office of Hamas in in DHA as a a Channel of communication um and they wanted to theq priority is basically you know a ceasefire to stop killing the civilians that's the priority they want to see people you know this ongoing killing in Gaza stopped immediately and I I think that is the message if this can save some Life we'll be great or my we'll leave it there for the moment we'll come back to you later on this as as things develop we will come back to it thanks a lot"}, "K_SKqJQpQU4": {"url":

for the release of Israeli hostages held by the militants announced just last hour that a pause in the fighting will begin tomorrow the first hostages will be released about 9 hours later here's how a spokesperson for qatar's foreign Ministry broke the news the times given are local to the war zone the beginning of the PA will be 7 a.m. Friday the 24th of November and it will last of course as agreed for four uh days and uh the first uh patch of civilians to to be released from razza will be around 400 p.m. of the same day they will be 13 in number all women and uh children around 240 civilian and Military hostages are held by Hamas and other groups their loved ones have waited anxiously for news of their release I don't know what kind of children will come back to us the trauma what they saw and until I see them in my own eyes I don't believe any lists of names and I don't believe any news coming today from anywhere I need to see them in my own eyes I need to hold my cousin in my arms the grief and Desperation goes on inside Gaza and so does the Israeli offensive these people are desperately searching through Rubble of buildings following an Israeli air strike on the southern city of Rafa that's an area Israeli authorities had previously declared to be part of a safe Zone there are reports of several deaths including a number of children although these remain unconfirmed now Israel says it attacked 30 00 Hamas targets over the last 24 hours so for more on this I want to bring in the cbc's Brier Stewart she's part of our news team on the ground in the region she joins us from Tel Aviv this hour so Brier the pause in the fighting and first hostage release was meant to happen today we heard the new schedule being announced by a Qatari official it's been delayed and many Express fears that the process might break down completely can you walk us through what we heard from the qari foreign Ministry and and what will happen in terms of the truce and hostage release yes I think there was Ary a lot of anxiety uh when it was announced that the deal was going to be delayed and that's because originally um Egypt officials had talked about uh it being the pause starting today at 10:00 a.m. Israel never confirmed anything like that but people expected to see the first group of hostages come out today and so there was a lot of anxiety but now we've heard from um officials and cter that the pause and fighting which they're calling a humanitarian pause is going to begin tomorrow at 700 a.m. and that the first group of hostages uh in Gaza will be released at 4 now there's going to be 13 it's expected that there will be 13 that will come out and then after they are handed over to the Red Cross you will then have Palestinians who are in prisoned in Israel released uh we understand that that group The the list of them anyway um is the majority of them are young uh men and boys between the ages of 14 and 18 now in terms of the the hostages uh there's been a lot of talk about lists and and who will be in that group coming out we know that the deal talks about children and women uh there are more than 30 children in in Gaza taken hostage the youngest being just 10 months old and it's our understanding that the families of those children will not find out that they're going to be released ahead of time they're only going to find out afterwards after they've been handed over to the Red Cross obviously the concern is they don't want to raise people's hopes to then have something um happen at the last minute where where you know the people that come out it was not as as planned so uh I think they're trying to take a very conservative approach with that um and you know there there was discussion uh the minister the official rather from Carter was asked a lot of questions about why there was this delay and he had said that to his knowledge the deal hadn't changed the agreement was the same way it it was when it was originally drafted here's some more of his uh his press conference the criteria on which to prioritize the hostages was purely humanitarian as uh as you know and our Focus was on getting the women and children uh out of Harm's Way as uh as soon as possible which is basically what we are doing within this uh this agreement and uh we will be going through hopefully that the momentum carried by this deal would help us get everybody out in uh in time and in the same time of course lesson the hardship of the people in res through the humanitarian POS that is taking place and I think it's important to note that there were some families that were taken hostage alog together so the children and the parents so it's very likely that families if they haven't been split up already we will be split up during this and um as I said there's just a lot of a lot of anxiety here there's people who have their loved ones who are men and they they know that they're not going to be released that they're not part of this first round anyway and and um you know PE people have really mixed emotions and I think when speaking to relatives as we have been here they also say that they don't want to get their hopes up too much because things can happen this is an active war zone you have two Waring sides and the official from Carter kind of alluded to that saying that uh you know they people are committed to this deal they think it's it's all ready to go uh but there are some things that are are still unpredictable and I think we have to watch for that and now of course Brier a key part of this deal is was also that pause and the fighting to allow for much needed Aid to come in so what are we hearing about the situation today well that's right hundreds of trucks in Aid are supposed to come in that's food medicine fuel which we know is so badly needed we've heard from Aid officials there about how uh there's not enough fuel to run the Water Systems to run sewage even to keep the communication lines open uh we know that the the pause and fighting hasn't stopped yet or stop started yet far from it in fact because bombardments continued overnight there were strikes in Rafa which is a city right near the border with Egypt in Han Yunis uh there were air strikes and local residents say also artillery strikes at least 15 people were killed there that's what uh officials are saying and that's an area that's really bursting at the seams because hundreds of thousands of people from the north have fled South where they uh were told it would be safer and it is relatively safer but certainly the Israeli military has signal signaled that it's going to intensify uh its operation in the South but there will be uh that will be held off of course while this while this pause is going on and I also want to mention um the hospital that we have been following so closely alifa that is where it was surrounded by uh intense fighting you had Israel accusing Hamas of using the building as part of their uh command and control center we've seen them talk about um tunnels uh produce EV you know what they say is evidence of tunnels and War rooms near the facility Well the director of the hospital uh Dr Muhammad Abu Alia he has been uh detained by Israel's military uh it's been reported that he was on his way out from the north uh in a convoy with patients and medical staff that were being evacuated and that he was stopped for questioning and Israel has confirmed that he is still in their custody uh and they believe that um he would have I mean they claim that he would have had to have known that there was some kind of act ity in the hospital because they say that uh you know the the the presence of Hamas um should have been obvious they talked about how the group was using electricity using space they say that they found weapons there I mean these are all things that Israel is claiming um obviously I'm not there we're not able to to verify it ourselves right now but I can tell you that I talked to the director of the hospital several times I probably have had six or seven conversations with him and each time I did ask him whether he was seeing fighters in the hospital was he seeing weapons uh each time he he he did tell me no but it has been very we I haven't been able to get in touch with him uh for a week I can tell you that um but now we can confirm that he is in Israel's custody and he is being questioned thank you for the update on all of this Brier that is the cbc's Brier Stewart in Tel Aviv"}, "xkGK0ENg_qU": {"url":

IT'S TIME TO BRING IN AN I.D.s. OAKS PERSON, TO TALK MORE ABOUT THE SITUATION THERE. JONATHAN, I APPRECIATE YOU BEING THERE. IT DOES SEEM AS THOUGH THERE'S OPTIMISM AND WE ARE CLOSE TO A DEAL HERE. IF THAT DEAL DOES HAPPEN, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR THE IDF? ISRAELI TROOPS REMAIN INSIDE GAZA EVEN DURING THIS CEASE- FIRE, AND WHAT IS THE MILITARY'S BIGGEST CONCERN ABOUT HOW THE CEASE-FIRE WILL BE IMPLEMENTED? >> THAT AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. THERE ARE MANY MOVING PARTS AND WE HAVE TO BE VERY, VERY CAREFUL WHEN WE ASSESS ANY DEALS MADE WITH THE HAMAS. HAMAS HAS A PROVEN RECORD OF NOT HONORING COMMITMENTS, AND FIRING AFTER A CEASE-FIRE COMES INTO EFFECT. THE LAST TIME THEY DID SO WAS IN 2014 WHEN THEY ABDUCTED ON ISRAELI OFFICER AT THE TIME, SO WE KEEP THAT FRESH IN MIND. WE WILL IMPLEMENT WHATEVER THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT CABINET VOTES ON, AND WHATEVER DECISION IS MADE, IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY. OF COURSE, OUR CREW WILL CONTINUE TO BE PRESENT IN GAZA. WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE FOCUSED AND DEPLOYED IN THE AREA, AND COME DOWN WITH WHATEVER NECESSARY OPERATIONS TO DEFEND OURSELVES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT. AND WE MUST BE, OF COURSE, VERY VIGILANT AND CAREFUL. WE KNOW THAT THE ENEMY WILL NOT LIKELY TRY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS PIECE HIGHER IN ORDER TO IMPROVE ITS TACTICAL POSITIONS, AND WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED FOR THAT SCENARIO. >> YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU DON'T TRUST HAMAS IN SITUATIONS LIKE THESE. HOW DOES THAT AFFECT THE EFFORT TO BRING HOSTAGES HOME SAFELY? HOW DO YOU BALANCE THOSE TWO THINGS? >> WE WILL HAVE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS, RIGHT? BECAUSE IT'S A DEAL THAT, ACCORDING TO THE REPORTS -- AND I THINK YOUR REPORTING IS CORRECT. BUT ACCORDING TO THE REPORTS, THEN IT WILL BE ON A DAY BY DAY BASIS. WE WILL SEE HOW HAMAS DELIVERS ON THE AGREEMENTS THE FIRST DAY, AND THEN WE WILL CARRY THAT ONTO THE NEXT DAY. BUT THERE WILL BE ROOM FOR A LOT OF VIGILANT AND SKEPTICISM, AND WE HAVE TO BE READY FOR ANY EVENTUALITY. WE KNOW THAT HAMAS HAS COMPLETE DISREGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE, WHETHER IT IS ISRAELI OR PALESTINIAN. THEY COULDN'T CARE LESS ABOUT THE WELL-BEING OF THEIR OWN PEOPLE, AND OF COURSE, THEY ARE ONLY USING OUR HOSTAGES FOR LYRICAL LEVERAGE. WE KEEP THAT IN MIND. WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT, HAMAS, AS THEY ARE A CORRUPT AND HATE FILLED ORGANIZATION TO KILL JEWS IN ISRAELI, AND THAT'S HOW WE LOOK AT EVERYTHING THEY DO AND  SAY. >> THE IDF IS ALREADY SECURE THE RELEASE OF FIVE PEOPLE THAT WERE BEING HELD HOSTAGE BY HAMAS. HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO GLEAN ANY INFORMATION FROM THEM ABOUT THE OPERATION IN GAZA? >> YES. FROM THEM, AND ALSO FROM HAMAS COMBATANTS THAT WE HAVE TAKEN CAPTIVE ON THE BATTLEFIELD, AND INTERROGATED QUITE THOROUGHLY. THEY HAVE REVEALED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, WHICH IS INVALUABLE, AND THAT IS COMPILED BY ISRAELI MILITARY INTELLIGENCE TO IMPROVE OUR SITUATIONAL AWARENESS, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, TO IMPROVE THE ABILITY TO GET OUR HOSTAGES BACK. JUST FOR THOSE WHO MAY HAVE MISSED IT, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 46 DAYS. ISRAELI WOMEN, CHILDREN, BABIES, INFANTS. AND MEN AND WOMEN AS WELL AS BEING HELD BY HAMAS FOR 46 DAYS. AND IN INHUMANE CONDITIONS, AND DIRECT VIOLATION OF EVERYTHING THAT IS RIGHT AND HUMAN, AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL START SEEING SOME OF THEM BACK. BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THE AIM OF OUR WAR AGAINST HAMAS IS TO DISMANTLE HAMAS, AND WHAT WE ARE SEEING NOW IS JUST ONE MILES KNOWN IN THE BIGGER SCHEME OF THINGS TO GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET HOSTAGES BACK, AND THEN WE WILL CONTINUE FIGHTING HAMAS UNTIL WE ERADICATE THEM. >> THERE'S OBVIOUSLY STILL A GREAT CONCERN ABOUT THE PALESTINIANS THAT ARE LIVING IN GAZA. MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN DISPLACED. IF THERE IS ANY SORT OF A CEASE- FIRE, WOULD ANY OF THEM BE ABLE TO RETURN TO THEIR HOMES, ESPECIALLY IN NORTHERN GAZA? OR IS IT STILL YOUR BELIEF THAT THEY NEED TO EVACUATE THAT AREA AND GET TO THE SOUTHERN PART OF THAT REGION? >> YES, THE HUMANITARIAN CONCERNS ARE VERY URGENT. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS, THE NONCOMBATANT, ARE SAFE. AND THEY NEED TO REMAIN IN SOUTHERN GAZA WHERE THEY ARE. THOSE THAT ARE IN THE NORTH, STILL, WE CALL ON THEM TO EVACUATE, BECAUSE FIGHTING IS NOT DONE IN NORTHERN GAZA. AS YOUR REPORTER COLLECTIVELY REPORTED, THERE'S FIGHTING AND IN OTHER AREAS, OTHER HAMAS STRONGHOLDS IN GAZA, AS WE SPEAK. AND THAT CONTINUES UNTIL ANYTHING CHANGES, UNTIL THERE IS ANY TYPE OF AGREEMENT. WE CONTINUE TO FIGHT AND ATTACK THE ENEMY, AND WE WANT TO SAFEGUARD CIVILIANS. WE STILL CALL ON THEM TO MOVE TOWARD THE SOUTH, AND ONCE THE FIGHTING IS DONE IN THE NORTH, THAT I'M SURE THAT WE WILL ISSUE GUIDANCE ACCORDINGLY TO THE PALESTINIANS. I HOPE THAT ANY CEASE-FIRE WILL BE USED BY HAMAS FIRST AND FOREMOST TO TAKE CARE OF THE CIVILIANS IN GAZA. THE PALESTINIANS WHO REALLY NEED HUMANITARIAN AID. BUT SOMETHING TELLS ME BASED ON THEIR BEHAVIOR SO FAR THAT THEY WON'T BE USING IT IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS ARE SAFE. THEY WILL BE USING THE TIME AND ENERGY AND RESOURCES MADE AVAILABLE FOR THEIR MILITARY PURPOSES AND NOT TO CARE FOR CIVILIANS. >> I WANT TO TALK TO YOU NOW ABOUT THE FIGHTING THAT'S HAPPENING IN AND AROUND THESE HOSPITALS IN GAZA. OF COURSE, IT'S ONE OF THE HOTSPOTS RIGHT NOW. YOUR GOVERNMENT HAS DENIED SHELLING THE HOSPITAL, INSTEAD SAYING IT WAS TARGETING ENEMY FIRE FROM WITHIN THE HOSPITAL. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT HAMAS IS ALSO OPERATING AT THIS HOSPITAL, AS YOU SAID, THEY WERE OPERATING AT OTHER HOSPITALS? YOU HAVE SPECIFIC INTELLIGENCE THAT WOULD LEAD YOU TO THAT CONCLUSION? >> NOT ONLY INTELLIGENCE, PROOF ON THE GROUND. A FEW WEEKS BACK, FROM THE HOSPITAL, WHICH WAS A VERY NICE AND WELL ESTABLISHED AND MODERN FACILITY, HAMAS FIRED AT ISRAELI TROOPS FROM WITHIN THAT HOSPITAL. AND WE HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME THING, AND OF COURSE, IN AND AROUND AL SHIFA. BY THE WAY, WHEN WE TOOK THE AL SHIFA COMPOUND,  NOT A SINGLE PALESTINIAN CIVILIAN WAS WOUNDED OR KILLED. AND THAT IS NOT BY CHANCE. IT IS BY DESIGN, BECAUSE WE FIGHT WHILE RESPECTING THE HUMAN DIGNITY AND THE NEED FOR POTENTIAL OF CIVILIANS. ANY LOSS OF LIFE, OF MEDICAL PERSONNEL OR NONCOMBATANTS, IS NOT THE INTENDED OUTCOME, AS WE ARE WORKING VERY HARD IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECT ON CIVILIANS. WE CANNOT ALWAYS GUARANTEE IT. I DON'T KNOW STATISTICALLY HOW THESE DOCTORS DIED AND WHAT HAPPENED ON THE GROUND. I HAVE HEARD THE REPORTS, WE ARE LOOKING INTO IT, BUT I CAN SAY CATEGORICALLY, YES, HAMAS SYSTEMATICALLY USES HOSPITALS, AND THIS HAS BEEN PROVEN, I THINK, BEYOND ANY DOUBT, THAT THEY USE THE HOSPITALS FOR MILITARY PURPOSES FOR NONMEDICAL PURPOSES TO FIGHT AGAINST US.

until we see the hostages back in November Gata negotiated a week-long truth during which Hamas exchanged more than 100 hostages kidnapped during the October 7 attack for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons Hamas still holds 136 hostages and bodies of captives killed in the fighting in Gaza G prime minister Muhammad Abdul Rahman Alani together with with the intelligence Chiefs of the United States Israel and Egypt has drafted a plan based on proposals by Hamas and Israel involving a prolonged ceasefire and swap of all hostages and bodies for an unspecified number of Palestinians in Israeli prisons the main obstacle to an agreement is that Hamas insists on a permanent ceasefire that would end the war while Israel maintains that ending the war is non-negotiable the parties also have yet to agree on the staggered ratio of Palestinians to be released for each Hamas held hostage and the identity of the Palestinians to be freed considering hamas's main bargaining chip is its hostages the group might insist on keeping a few hostages to make sure Israel abides by an agreement a demand Israel is certainly to reject alternatively a Hamas official suggested that the group May seek guarantees from the United States gbsar and Egypt that the ceasefire amounts to an end to the war our aim is to finish this as soon as possible to bring the hostages back but to put a closure for the war as well Mr Alani told national public radio it's going to take fancy language to bridge the gap the trick will be a formula that allows both parties to claim they have achieved their irreconcilable goals one formula may be a lengthy ceasefire potentially described as transitional rather than permanent this would allow Israel to maintain that the war will continue while Hamas could claim the contrary Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin netan has not made things easier by adopting Hardline in recent days he has not only rejected ending the war but also the release of thousands of terrorists and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza anytime soon Mr netan may sing a different tone this weekend in talks with US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin on his sixth visit to Israel since the War Began but any hostage swap agreement will likely int Provisions that could prompt his far-right Coalition Partners to withdraw from the government Mr netanel May hope that Hamas will rescue him by rejecting anything less than an end to the war and the release of thousands of Palestinians in Israeli prison in exchange for the hostages the state department and British foreign secretary David Cameron in an apparent attempt to pressure Mr netan to soften his rejection of the creation of an independent Palestinian State and approach to hostage negotiations are exploring possibilities of recognizing Palestine as a state so far the US and Britain have recognized president Mahmud abbas's West Bank based Palestine Authority as the entity governing the West Bank an official Palestinian interlocutor under the 1993 Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization or PLO this week's Us sanctioning a for Vigilante is West Bank settlers sends a similar message even if small in Number the demonstrations in the US in Canada Echo Mr Nan's recent criticism of gatar you're out here me thaning gatar it is essentially no different from the UN or Red Cross and in a certain sense is even more problematic I have no elusions about them they have leverage over Hamas why do they have leverage because they finance them Mr netan told hostage families last month ignoring that gy funding of Hamas in Gaza was at his beest dat hosts the heads of Hamas it also funds Hamas it has leverage on us they Place themselves as mediators so start proving it and bring back our hostages Mr netan said in a subsequent news conference this week the midle East media Research Institute memory founded by yigal caramon a former advisor to Israel's West Bank and Gaza occupation Authority and prime ministers yak shamia and Yak Rabin sought to boast of Mr netanyahu's argument memory reported that godaba regularly trained amasus police force in response G's foreign Ministry accused Mr netan of undermining the mediation process for reasons that appear to serve his political career instead of prioritizing saving the lives of Innocents including Israeli hostages echoing Mr Net's criticism and American Jewish leaders frustration Democrats and Republicans in the US Congress have asked the Biden Administration to pressure gatar the lawmakers also called for hamas's expulsion from gatar the United States agreed with G in October to revisit the gulf State's relationship with Hamas once all hostages have been released officials of both countries left open whether the review would lead to the expulsion of Hamas Representatives or to restrictions on their ability to operate from the Gulf State what the review will entail is likely to depend on whether and in what state Hamas survives the Gaza War a Hamas survival could mean that the United States and for that matter Israel will have a continued need for a back Chanel nevertheless the criticism threatens to put a dent in gy relations with the American Jewish Community a pillar of its largely successful soft power strategy in the United States AAS has maintained a presence in gatar since 2012 at the request of the United States and with Israel's acence gatar and the administration have pushed back at the criticism I've been hearing this a lot about the leverage and the pressure G needs to be understood clearly in this context our role as a mediator is to try to bring the parties to bridge the gap between them Mr Alani said in an onstage interview at the Atlantic Council of Washington Think Tank Beyond this leverage we don't see that God is a superpower that can impose something on this party or another party to bring them to that place basically we're using our good offices to connect the bridge gaps to put Solutions and come up with some Alternatives he added Roger Carston US President Joe Biden's top hostage Envoy told the hostages families forum and the American Jewish committee that g is doing everything we're asking members of The Forum met last week with Mr Alani to thank him for his efforts even so Emily maati a member of the forum's Diplomatic team and a former Israeli Parliament member suggested the families were holding their NOS while working with gatar the Forum thinks that the only way hostages will be released is through negotiations and as unfortunate as it may be we would prefer Egypt G is totally a partner in this Mrs Muti said in a Twist of irony a g funded consultant Jay footl helped the families get meetings with Mr Alani and other gy officials and Coach them on how to approach those encounters G pays Mr foot lck's consultancy third circle Inc $440,000 a month thank you for joining me today I hope you enjoyed today's column and

Let's  continue  with  these  developments  want  to  bring  into the conversation.  our  friend  National Security  expert  and retired Marine   intelligence  officer how  Kemper  who's been  guiding  us  through this  war each   and every day how joins me   now,  how good  to see  you  you and I are over  the last   week  or so have  talked   about increasing. attacks by   Iranian proxies.  on   US forces.  stationed in   the region  in  places  like   Iraq  and in  places, like   Syria,  we're gonna  getting some  breaking  news   in  at  the moment. I want   to put  this  tweet up  from   Fox News. National  Security   correspondent.  Jennifer   Griffin at  the Pentagon. She  says  the US. military   carried out airstrikes. on   Iranian proxy forces  in   Syria.  moments ago  in response to  recent   attacks on  us  bases.  since  October the 17th, so   all I was asking  you just   this  very  time yesterday.  What  will the  response  be   had there not been  a  response  yet,  and we're  seeing  a response. literally  as  we  speak as  we  brought  you into  the program  hear your response  now  to this.  to this.  Well, my   Andrew  my  response would be  that's the  response. That's   what  I would expect   would be. airstrikes.  strikes we  have  the  resources over  there.  We   have the  unit's the   capabilities. The other thing  is  we  can bring in  a  variety of  ordinance. That  is  very  suited  for what?  what  wants to  be   accomplished  here. The big  thing is  you're  trying to  create  enough. Devastation  if  you will  enough   destruction.  whatever  it is  you're trying to  take  out  in this case. at  their  launching drones  or  if   they're sending missiles. You  want to take  out that? grown  launching or  that  missile  facility, which means you  want  to  bring in a  lot of   heavy Ordnance  and they   could be  some  distance   away  could be  well  outside  of  mortar  range.  I  don't know  if  they  have   any artillery.  you know,  there's a variety of  things   but I have  to  take the air   strikes.  very  very  well   suited  for those types of   response  missions. and  pardon  expression. They   make  they make a big  impression. if  you know   what  I mean, okay. on  the  on  the enemy and so  and I  think  we will see more of that.  I think what we're   going to do is  every time   you do  see something  that we're  going to  plan  a  response  or  we're going  to have a response  for them.  And and I'm not saying  it's   would pro quo,  but it's   going to  look  a lot like   that  because it's just  got to be very  clear if  you  attack  US forces.  we  will   respond and I just  want to  say what  you're  seeing   there.  is  completely   consistent. with  what the   White House made  very  clear  yesterday.  that   they're going to  do   sometimes the time. Timing is  not as  fast. I mean,  I've heard  some  criticism  in  the news  today.   They go.  Well, they  didn't   respond yet.  you know.  operational planning  takes a  little  time  to  do  a right  and they  pick  their time.  but you never thought they   were  never going to  respond  and that's  just not  on  the  table.  That's  not in our   Playbook, right?  I  didn't think  we would  sit  back  and just  let that   happen  because if  we  do,  it from a force protection.  standpoint. you're  just   inviting  them to do  more   now.  I will  tell  you as   an  intelligence officer   Sometimes you do  things   that seem a little   counterintuitive. because I'm  watching  them  and and and  I'm watching him closely   because I'm going to  do   instead of  going for the  little  kill now. I'm  going to  go  for a big kill   later.  All right,  I know   that  sounds  horrible  and  some  people   are going to say  gosh. It's   terminology on  that. but  you're  going for the  targeting the strike  and so   there might be  times where  you're waiting  to  see  a more  lucrative.  Target  a  high payoff Target  appear   You know, it's  out there.   you might do  some things  that  would provoke them  to   reveal  themselves  to you   and things  like  that, I  think that's  actually   what the  Israelis  are doing  right now,  too.  and Gaza   is  uncovering  things  by   doing provocative things  and  that's  that's  just  that's   the trade craft that   was part of the Art of  War  and we'll get to  Israel  and  Gaza  and Hamas.  in just a  moment, but this  is   breaking  right now.  I  want to put this  tweet up   from  our own Lucas  Tomlinson.  This  was from   earlier today and he  was  citing. Jennifer  Griffin's  reporting at the  Pentagon   in the  briefing  today.   that  attacks on US forces   in the Middle East  continue   today this  time  in erbil   in  Northern  Iraq. That's   according to  the Pentagon   spokesman Brigadier General.   Pat Rogers, So  as  of   today,  have  these  attacks on US troops  US   forces  contractors in the   region. were  ongoing and I  think this  is  really   interesting as well.  I  want to put this  up  this is  from  our friend. Laura  seligmann at  Politico  and  she tweeted out this  today.   with  some  reporting that   she did she says  19   American  Service members in   Iraq  and Syria have  been   diagnosed with  traumatic  brain.  injury. after  rocket and  drone attacks  from  Iran  back  militants.   last   last week that saccharine  according to  a  defense department   officials.  So  this  has  real  consequences. to   u.s. Troops in  the region.  Remember  we  were  only   told  quote unquote minor  injuries  how traumatic brain  injuries  that's  serious.   it  Androids it is  serious  and one of the things is  we   diagnosis better. I got  to tell you.  if  you go   back. certainly when  I  started in  uniform.  we   probably  had traumatic brain  injuries  all over the   place,  but it's  kind of  like  football. nobody   really   understood it very well.   well, and certainly nobody   talked  about it  much. you  don't see it. but the  ability to  diagnose  that   now is  much  better  than   being much  more  careful  about that  to  make  sure   they  they  deal  with  those  things  and and and TB   is you know,  untreated.  can  can cause some  very  serious  problems. later on. and so   they're there.   they're they're being very   forthright. I'm glad  that   they're being very  public   about this  or  putting that   out there.  but I will  also   say this  that's  part of the  response packet.   Could you can't say that?  Nobody was  harmed when  you have  people harmed  and that  also tells  me   those Munitions and with  TBI  kind  of  the way it's   described.  my  presumption  is  it's  a shock wave  from   the explosion.  the  concussive  effects, which   are actually  causing the  TBI.  to  appear. which means  that  nobody's  was probably   hit with  shrapnel  or   something.  I don't know   that  but I'm assuming   that's  probably  the case.  but they  were  close enough   that they causes  effects.   You know, how Ow. is this all  happening?  in the  aftermath  of  the Hamas attack  into   Southern  Israel? is the   second  and third order  effects playing out in  real   time  And then  what  happens  from  here? I mean  do we  think Iran  is  going to   respond since we just struck   some  of  their proxies in   Syria It  seems like   that's the  domino effect  here  Is  it  not Andrew   that's  a that's a  fantastic  question, you know.  everything  is  being looked   at  in  the prism of  post   October 7th.  Yeah. and the  reality is  that  some of  these proxies have  been   doing attacks against our  forces  well  before  October  7th,  and it  was an  ongoing  periodic  problem.  with   dealing with  various  different.  militias.  terrorist groups  if  you  will. in  these regions in   Syria in  Iraq  this   has been  ongoing so   now what  Doing is   we're keeping score.   There was a distinct  uptick   Is  there something  where they  can say?  October  7th was a green light for  them  to do more. operations   the against US  forces   certainly if  you look  at   the rhetorical  the  rhetorical  envelope  that   this  is  put into  the  information space.  what's   been said by  Iran? and some   of  the proxies themselves.  around  the region  you would  certainly say region  is   very  consistent. They  say  they're going to  do  this   stuff and they're doing this   stuff.  and and certainly  from  a policy  standpoint.  I think at some point we  do   have  to  take  some of this   at face value.  now,  right  now we're going we're  responding  to the  proxies  US  policy   as we don't want to expand   this  into  a regional  War.   right?  variety good   reasons.  We  don't want  gas  prices  to  double  at the   pump  We  don't want  store  shelves to  empty out at the   Suez Canal  get shut down  because the Bob Emma  Deb  straight  cannot  be   traversed.  There's a lot of   different reasons.  why we   don't want  to  spend it on  the other hand. when  our  forces  are attacked. They   have  the inherent  right of   self-defense  and that's   what  you're  seeing   practiced right there.  Okay?  Yeah, but how you also  have   all the criticism of  the B  Administration  about  you know, why we  hadn't   retaliated  yet.  Okay.  We retaliate  it  tonight.   We  may retaliate even   further into  the weekend.   and then  all the concerns   about you know, what   Iran would  do  as  a counter  retaliation and would that   in  a sense?  Trigger or   antagonize? the one proxy I'm  thinking of.  Hezbollah in   the north of  Israel. on   Israel's  northern  border.  Those concerns  are there as   well, right?  I would assume.  and we've talked  about this   since October 7th.  Yeah,  there is  a lot of  very   direct. communication to   Hezbollah.  There are two  aircraft  carrier task   Force's sitting  off the coast.  with  a  phenomenal amount of   strike capability along with   everything  that  Israel   could be  can bring to bear.   against Hezbollah  in southern Lebanon.  and in   Syria,  There's also  a  bigger  backdrop. and and  ideal this  not  just this isn't just   knowing this  is  dealing  with  military  officials  from  Lebanon.  in   The Fairly  recently,  you know  in the last year   or two years. and I will   tell  you that  country is   is  broken. the economy,   you know  first  they know they have the  massive Financial.  crisis.  They  had the explosion  at the  Port  which caused.  huge. Devastation to   critical  infrastructure   and Beirut along  with  all  the loss  of  life  and  everything else.  and the  economy has shrunk over 50%  in  just  a few years.  It's   a stunning  when  you look   at  how bad that  country is   and they  don't know  what   they  don't know  how to  fix  it. Yeah  and so  part of  what's being  communicated.  not just  Hezbollah but also   through Lebanese  government   that talks   a Hezbollah, which  is  if   this  happens.  you may cross  the Rubicon.  were  Lebanon  can never be  fixed.  That's   how bad it is and that's   what's being  communicated.  So  that  is  a restraint  that's  being put on   Hezbollah,  which is  if  you  launch  this  you know, if   you want  to  follow  up  on   your  rhetoric. you could  destroy not just  Hezbollah.   you could destroy southern   Lebanon and Lebanon.  because  this is the backdrop,  this is the context with   which this whole   thing would be playing  out.   Okay?  now while we have you now  as well,  we're getting  statements  in  from   Secretary of  Defense Lloyd,   Austin  Fox News  White House  correspondent.  Jackie,  Heinrich. tweeting  out.  the  Austin  statement about these  airstrikes. Let's put that   up  right now,  so  Austin   says  this  today at   President Biden's Direction  u.s. Military forces   conducted self-defense   strikes on  two facilities   in Eastern Sea. area  used by  Iran's  Islamic  revolutionary guard Corps the  irgc  and Affiliated  groups   it  goes  on  to say  these  precision.  self-defense   strikes are a response  to  a  series  of  ongoing and  mostly  unsuccessful. attacks  against us  personnel.  in   Iraq  and Syria.  by  Iran   back  militia groups  that   began on  October 17th, it   goes  on  to say  as  a  result  of  these attacks.   one u.s. Citizen  contractor   died  from  a cardiac  incident  while Sheltering in  place and 21 us Personnel  suffered  from  minor  injuries  but all have  since  returned  to  duty. the  president has no  higher   priority  than  the safety   of  us  personnel.  and he   directed  today's action   to make clear that  the  United  States  will  not  tolerate  such  attacks.  and  will  defend  itself.  its personnel and its  interests.  how that's  also   breaking  news. The statement  goes  on  to  say this  the  United  States  does not   seek  conflict. has no   intention or desire to   engage  in   further hostilities but these  iranian-backed  attacks  against US  forces  are  unacceptable. and must  stop.  so  so  Jackie  Heinrich   tweeting  out the full   statement from  Lloyd Austin,  but how that's  news. u.s.   Contractor  died  suffered a   cardiac event.  huddling  in   safety  while these attacks  were  ongoing.  It's  a very   stressful thing when you  got  incoming. it's  stressful.   Yeah, and those spaces  are  tight and and I have  to  say  some of the contractors or   are well  frankly.   They're guys  like  me  All  right,  we've been  around   for a while.  and and we're  out there and it  can  you know, depending on   what's  going on, you know,  they  may not.  they may   have  pre-existing   conditions. a lava  things,  but but that  is  you know,  obviously there was impact   obviously a injuries  there.   there weren't any  any combat fatality.   qualities per se  in  other  words  the musicians themselves   didn't  cause any direct.  fatalities  or  serious.   injuries. although  TBI is   serious,  but it   did say that they were   returned  to  duty. but these  things  are being responded  to  what  you don't see and  what we probably  don't know   right now.  is  what  were   the effects of  F-16  strikes  as somebody who is  called   in  more  than  than than you  know, my  fair share  of  And  use a variety of  Munitions  from  variety of  platforms.   I can tell  you that  we   probably  dished out  a lot  of  destructive force and I  would be  surprised that   they  got off as  easily. as   as. as what that  indicates.   where the effects on our   forces. All right,  how  I mean  this  was really   just  perfect timing.  Our because this   was all happening when   you came  right into   the conversation. so  we  do   want to get to  those some   of  these questions.  I have   about how this  war between  Israel and  Hamas.  is  going  to  go  even  further so   before  we  get into  some   of  my  questions here, I do   want to point out.  and show   our viewers.  this  this   video that  the Israeli  Defense Forces. posted  on.  Twitter.  just  late last  night.  and if  you can help   us  explain what  we're  seeing  right now in  this   video,  please  chime in   here  how so  you can see?   you have  some? Israeli what   looks like. tanks or   bulldozers  there and I  believe this  is  either   on or inside. the border   between Gaza  and Southern   Israel  at how  have  you  seen  this  and if you  have   what are we looking at  here?  Well, this  is  all  night. So you're  looking at   night vision. capability   here. This  is  what's   called  a armored rate.  essentially.  what   you're saying or  tanks  armored vehicles   armored personnel carriers.  you're  seeing  a lot of   engineer  Vehicles  punching   through the fence.  a lot  things  clearing  minefields.  what  it  was called  a raid   and it  was called  the  biggest raid. So  so far, but  what  they're doing is   they're they're literally  going through before  the  main  effort  happens.   They're going through.  and  they're they're basically  hitting a specific  Lane.  they're taking  out certainly  any enemy positions that   they  would see in  that   area. they're looking for  bunkers.   where there might be   crew-served weapons.   That could  be  employed   them. there also  trying to  find  out as much as  they   can about minefields  booby  traps Anything else They can   that's  out there.  if you   look right  here, you'll see.  that  they have a basically  it's  a it's a  military   Dozer.  bulldozer.   that's used to  push  through  berm  lines.  what  they   have  done. is  they have  actually  kind of  cleared a lane. that  could  be  used  and and of  course   for the Hamas they're going  to  be  looking at  this   lame  saying  that's  where  the Israelis. might come   through the Israelis  went   up  to  this  point.  They   cleared the slain.  all the  stuff that  we  have  put  there is  no  longer  there.   And of  course   they're saying  and if  we go  out there and try to  put  something in  there.   we're very  likely  going to   get hit.  so   they're they're they're  probably  not going to  do   that. So  they'll be  looking  at that lane. but then   you get into  that  for  a real  question, which is   is  that  where they  want   us to be  looking because  they're going to  come  in   some  other way.  that   again,  that's  kind  of  The  Art of  War which is   deception.  and all the  things  that go into  that   but this  was a very   substantial.  rate  force  that went in  and and by   the way when  I use the term   raid  what  I mean  by  that   is  it  is  they are  not  there to  stay   They're not there to hold the  terrain,  because they go  when they do  their mission  then  they  come  back  out.   Okay, that's  it. That's   a very good.  other in   Israel and  Gaza. So what  you're  saying how  cuz what   it looks  like to me  is   very  offensive.  but  underneath  all that. it's   strictly  Preparatory.  for  it  will  ground  invasion.  It  is  Preparatory.   There's a there's a  brigadier.  British Brigadier  General.  after World War one  had a wonderful World that   we've used  forever.  which  is  time spent   reconnaissance  is  seldom   wasted. This  is  some well  spent time. Not only   are they  clearing  the lane.  They're also  collecting   intelligence. or  conducting   reconnaissance. or  trying   to  find  out what's out   there.  they're that  as   we've been  talking about  that  term  I like   to use and told us   preparation of the   battlespace if  you will.  basically they're going out  there finding out all  the stuff that  they're going  to  use as  our finalizing   their plans for actually   going in. This  is   reconnaissance  in force  is   what  you're looking  at  and  and it  just  background.  I've  served  in a   couple different   reconnaissance  units,   you know  more  the  traditional Commando   type stuff  that   lot of people are familiar   with. but also  light  armoured  reconnaissance  and  that's sort of things that   we  would do  we  would go   in  there.  with  vehicles   with  a lot of  equipment.   things. and and we  would  push  very  far into  their  battle space  you know Behind  Enemy Lines going to   use that  term  but but go   in  there to collect   intelligence  and and and by   the way I'm not saying   they just collected they  may  have  left  something.  for  the for Hamas to  discover   if  Hamas goes  out there and  looked around I wouldn't  put  a wouldn't rule that out   either  so  how we   do have to  go  to  a  commercial  break?  but when   we  come  back  we're  going to  move. to a   different part  of the world.  We're going to move to  China  We're going to move from the   Middle East to  China.  a  major Chinese player   visiting, Washington  today.   We're all told  that  that   same  player  could  be meeting  with President   Biden tomorrow. So  that's   somewhat  significant.  this   as  still a lot of   close calls.  Let's put it   that  way with  aircraft   with  with  Marine  vessels.   between the United States.   and China and the  Philippines.

"joining us now retired fourstar General and Fox News senior strategic analyst Jack Keen General great to have you back with us great to be here so I want to start with something overnight we got from the defense secretary Austin talking about new assets moving into the region the Eisenhower strike group he specifically references escalations by Iran and its proxy forces I mean obviously Hezbollah Hamas among that what are the greatest threats you see now well certainly the number one threat is Hezbollah I mean they are they're a paramilitary force they have conventional capability they have 130,000 plus rockets and missiles that the Iranians have given them they got them from no place else and these are much more advanced more more Precision more lethality and actually uh more accuracy in terms of the the range of these weapons and what they what they can do on the ground so yes they have a significant capability Israelis have handled them before but struggled with it back in 2006 what we would see here is a a very heavy rocket and missile attack that can range all of the major cities we've never seen it on a scale that they actually have now when you look at what's actually happening on the ground with Hezbollah they have not evacuated any of their southern positions which they likely would have done with their people they have not gone to any kind of full mobilization yet which would they would they would likely do but the only thing that is relevant here and so our viewers understand it's Iran they will make this decision whether they go or not and that's likely has something to do with how things go in Gaza with the Israelis and what the perception is in the International Community as well it's going to be Iran's decisions just as the Hamas attack on Israel was Iran's decision I want to put up a a map of the region there because there's so many other countries that we're talking with we're trying to influence trying to stop this from spreading more broadly in the region um how are we doing on that point because as you said Iran many people believe is calling the shots but we have other actors there who can influence what's happening in the region yeah certainly um what the United States is doing first give the president credit for the speech uh the other night something I think when it comes to Ukraine should have been done a year ago but it's here now uh secondly certainly moving the military capability into the region that you're referencing is is very critical capability is part of deterrence the the adversary sees the capability and they know it's powerful and they know it would harm them the second thing that's crucial with deterence is are you willing to use it and that is where our adversaries have had doubts about the United States recently so I'm hoping that privately we are telling and poking a finger figuratively in the chest of the Iranians and saying don't make this move because we are dead serious that we will use this capability against your proxies and possibly against you yourself I'll leave the target selection up to the administration and the Pentagon but that is what deterrence is all about it's not just enough to move the capability that's there your adversaries got to believe you're going to use it I want to ask you quickly too because you're just back from Ukraine polls show us that people growing weary here at least about the financial support not knowing what the finish line is what can you tell us about what's happening there on the ground well first of all you got to realize all this is connected what's happening the United States is facing Global Security challenges we haven't seen since World War II Shannon I mean look at this we have three Geographic areas vital National interest Europe CH uh China in the indo-pacific region and also the Middle East War has broken out in two of those areas and in the third area of China he's threatening it this is not happening by accident they perceive that we don't have the capability to deter them anymore that we've lost some political will and he reflecting this loss of political will in Ukraine we not only have to support Ukraine Ukraine's Got to win this war it's related to these other two regions the world is becoming a more dangerous place and the United States weakness is what they perceive whether it's real or not it's irrelevant they perceive it we've got to win that war in Ukraine we cannot have Russia win that war if that happens China wins in sovi Iranians and what does it do it encourages them it emboldens them we all see the aggression that has increased in the last couple years it's it's not by accident it's their perception that they have one opportunity which is what the Germans the Japanese and the Italians thought in World War II and two the perception of weakness and it's here it's very dangerous uh General thank you for always giving us some of your insights and expertise

IT'S AN HONOR TO HAVE YOU WITH  US ON VETERANS DAY.   EVEN WHILE WE'RE NOT INVOLVED  IN THIS WAR, WE HAVE U.S.  SOLDIERS, 1200 ON BOOTS ON THE  GROUND IN HARM'S WAY, ATTACKED  FROM IRANIAN-BACKED ENTITIES.    WE GO AFTER THE REBEL GROUPS  FUNDED BY IRAN AND LEAVE IT AT  THAT.   WHAT DO YOU THINK? >> WELL, PERSONALLY, I'D JUST  LIKE TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT  STRATEGICALLY WHAT IT  HAPPENING.   I MEAN, THERE'S A RECOGNITION  AMONG MANY OF US IN FOREIGN  POLICY AND NATIONAL SECURITY  WHO WAKE UP EVERY DAY AND THIS  IS KIND OF WHAT WE WORK ON,  THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS LOST ITS ABILITY TO DETER ITS  ADVERSARIES.   OUR ADVERSARIES FOR THE LAST  TWO, THREE YEARS HAVE GOTTEN  CONSIDERABLY MORE AGGRESSIVE.   WE DID NOT DETER PUTIN IN  UKRAINE.   WE HAVE NOT DETERRED THE  IRANIANS FROM WHAT THEY'RE  ATTEMPTING TO DO HERE IN USING  THEIR INSTRUMENT, HAMAS, TO  DESTROY AS MUCH OF ISRAEL AS  THEY CAN, WEAKEN ISRAEL  POLITICALLY.   ISOLATE THEM GEOPOLITICALLY,  WORLDWIDE CONDEMNATION AGAINST  ISRAEL AND TRY TO FORCE A  COLLAPSE OF THE GOVERNMENT.   CERTAINLY, THEY'RE TRYING TO  DRIVE US OUT OF THE MIDDLE  EAST, WHICH HAS BEEN AN  OBJECTIVE FOR 43 YEARS AND  THAT'S WHY THEY'RE ATTACKING US NOW, I THINK, 48 TIMES SINCE  OCTOBER 7TH.   83 TIMES BEFORE THAT.  BUT EVEN MORE THAN THAT, WE  HAVE PRESIDENT XI, YOU  COMMENTED ON IT MANY TIMES, WE  HAVE DISCUSSED IT MANY TIMES,  HOW HE HAS STEPPED UP HIS  AGGRESSION AGAINST THE UNITED  STATES, AGAINST TAIWAN, AGAINST OUR ALLIES AND PARTNERS FOR THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS.   WE ARE NOT DETERRING THESE  ADVERSARIES.   THEY SEE LEADERSHIP IN THE  UNITED STATES, THEY BELIEVE  IT'S WEAK.   THIS IS THEIR PERCEPTION, AND  THEY THINK THEY CAN TAKE  ADVANTAGE OF US BECAUSE THE  UNITED STATES IS, GENERALLY  SPEAKING, IN DECLINE AND WE  DON'T HAVE THE SAME POLITICAL  WILL AND THEY LOOK AT OUR  MILITARY AND THEY SEE THE  FACTS, THAT THE MILITARY  POST-9/11 HAS ERODED.   IT'S CURRENT CAPABILITY IS NOT  AS STRONG AS IT USED TO BE.   STILL THE NUMBER ONE MILITARY  IN THE WORLD, BUT WHEN YOU PUT  IT IN CERTAIN SCENARIOS, IT'S  CHALLENGED.   ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE COMING  TOGETHER HERE AND THAT'S WHY  YOU SEE THE ATTACKS CONTINUING  TO ACCELERATE AGAINST U.S.  FORCES IN IRAQ AND SYRIA.   YOU KNOW, DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE'VE TRIED TO TELL THEM  THROUGH TWO AIR STRIKES, TO  KNOCK IT OFF.   THEY'RE NOT GOING TO KNOCK IT  OFF.   THAT'S THE REALITY OF IT, UNTIL YOU PUT SOMETHING ON THE TABLE  THAT THEY VALUE MORE AND YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE SOME RISK WITH  THAT IN ESCALATION.   AND NOT BE AFRAID THAT IT'S  GOING TO START A WAR WITH IRAN. THE 43 YEARS OF EVIDENCE  SUGGESTS THAT IRAN DOES NOT  WANT THE DIRECT CONFRONTATION  WITH THE UNITED STATES AND  THAT'S WHY THEY'VE DESIGNED THE BRILLIANT STRATEGY OF USING  PROXIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES,  TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS  PRIMARILY TO ATTACK US AND  DRIVE US OUT OF THE REGION.   WE DON'T WANT DIRECT  CONFRONTATION WITH US, BECAUSE  THAT'S THE END OF THEIR REGIME. NEIL: BUT, GENERAL, DON'T THE  IRANIANS KNOW THAT WE DON'T  WANT A DIRECT CONFRONTATION  GOING AFTER ENTITIES IN IRAN  AND THAT IS SOMETHING FROM  WHICH THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE? >> OH, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.   AND THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE, AFTER YOU TAKE DOWN THE PROXY'S  CAPABILITY TO ATTACK US, THAT  YOU PUT ON THE TABLE, THAT THE  IRGC TRAINING CENTER WHICH IS  BASED IN IRAN WHERE ALL OF  THESE PROXIES TRAIN.   THE HAMAS WAS THERE WITH 500 IN SEPTEMBER, FOR EXAMPLE.   PUT ON THE TABLE RIGC BASIS  WHICH REAGAN DID IN THE MID  '80S, HE TOOK DOWN PLATFORMS  AND IRGC BASES BECAUSE THEY  WERE INTERFERING WITH THE FLOW  OF OIL OUT OF THE PERSIAN GULF, WHICH IS ANOTHER ONE OF THEIR  MAJOR OBJECTIVES AND ALSO, PUT  THE IRGC HEADQUARTERS IN IRAN  ON THE TABLE.   THESE ARE THINGS THAT WILL GET  THEIR ATTENTION.   WE'VE HAD TWO PRESIDENTS THAT  HAVE DONE THIS, REAGAN IS ONE.  THE OTHER ONE IS CERTAINLY  PRESIDENT TRUMP, WHEN HE WENT  AFTER THE LEADER OF THE R  IRGC CUD FORCE AND KILLED HIM AND  BACK ON THEIR HEELS.   DID THEY CONDUCT AN ATTACK IN  RECRIMINATION, YES.   IT WAS A MEASURED ATTACK AND  WE'VE NEVER HEARD FROM THEM  SINCE UNDER THE TRUMP  ADMINISTRATION, I MEAN.   YES WE HAVE TO CONFRONT THE  IRANIANS OVER THIS ISSUE OR IT  WILL CONTINUE.   AFTER ALL, WE'RE TRYING TO  PREVENT AMERICANS FROM BEING  KILLED AND IT LOOKS LIKE AS  THEY CONTINUE TO CONDUCT THESE  ATTACKS AT SOME POINT, LUCK IS  GOING TO RUN OUT AND SADLY"}, "5OHrfEx99Yc": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OHrfEx99Yc", "video_id": "5OHrfEx99Yc", "description": "Israeli air strikes have targeted areas close to villages in southern Lebanon.

southern Lebanon missiles were fired at Hezbollah positions near kafar Shuba Israel has evacuated towns along the border with Lebanon after repeated exchanges of fire Zod reports from Southern Lebanon Israel's military says it's targeting Hezbollah positions across the border in Lebanon it's facing a guilla war the Iranian back Lebanese armed group has been attacking Israeli military positions along the border as well as tanks using Precision guided missiles the Waring sides have been trading fire along what has been an active front line since Israel started to attack Gaza more than a week ago Hezbollah joined the battle after a call by its Ally Hamas but it's very much limiting its response within the Rules of Engagement established since its last war with Israel in 2006 Israel says it doesn't want to be dragged into war on a second front but it has threatened to respond forcefully if attacked to engage hisbah in a full scale War it's it's a very risky thing it is not popular among the Lebanese uh population first and it has to have a green light from the Iranian regime because that might create new Dynamics in the Middle East altogether so a decision of that scale it has to be cleared by both the Iranian leadership and maybe syrians as well Hezbollah has said it's not neutral in the conflict its backer Iran has repeatedly warned of a war that would engulf the whole region if attacks against Gaza continue but the so-called axis of resistance hasn't said what their red line is except that Gaza will not fall in other words Hamas will not fall a decision by Hezbollah to enter the war with its full military capabilities could depend on how long its Ally can sustain Israeli attacks on its own Iran and its allies across the region are now focusing their anger on the US Administration they say it has given Israel free reign to carry out war crimes against the Palestinians since then there have been reports of attacks on the US military presence in Iraq and Syria and it exerts on the Americans additional pressure uh to tell them that you know if this war happen it will never it will not be in any way a conventional War it will have no limits no borders uh and uh attacks on Israel and its backers can be from anywhere for for the time being there is heated rhetoric while all sides appear to be weighing the risks and benefits of Confrontation but what appears to be shaping up is a protracted crossb War of Attrition zanah aljaz Southern Lebanon alaz Ali Hashem joins us from nura in southern Lebanon even as we keep an eye screen left on uh the uh scenes at the Israel Lebanon border where fires seem to be burning let's see if we can uh get any information on that with Ali Ali I don't know if you're in the vicinity of what I'm seeing but what are you learning about what's happening at the border right now well the border is on fire since this afternoon several attacks has been launched in uh different sectors from the East to the West now we are here on the West Western sector on the Mediterranean to the other side the Eastern sector is on the border with with Syria and of course Israel so there have been several attacks just behind me a few uh hours ago couple of hours ago the the Israeli posts here positions here were hit by uh anti- tank guided missiles from hisbah in accordance there were uh over 20 Miss Rockets that were launched by Hamas the Palestinian group Hamas in Lebanon now uh launching 20 rocket towards Northern Israel and also there there were bar there was a barrage of rockets towards Kona to the east U now we know that there are three people injured there so a lot of attacks a lot of uh uh T forat and this also is has been uh going on as as we know for the past 10 12 days yesterday in this morning very early this morning where we are there were two air strikes and the loud explosions Israeli airplanes hit heah targets here in this in this area and also uh other targets towards the east so uh the issue is that we are seeing more attacks on daily basis before we used to see one two three attacks today at least there are five six attacks and now with the this different uh uh approach given the rockets that hit a building in Katona and the reports coming from there that there are three uh people injured there this is different this is kind of changing the situation slightly and actually uh we've been we've been watching the uh uh situation gradually escalating but it seems that we are in a new phase this is not the same phase that we witnessed at the first days this is another phase and there's something I would like to uh uh emphasize on it seems also that hasah while attacking the Israeli posts on the borders they are kind of uh concentrating on hitting some communication apparat apparatuses and tools like um cameras uh uh that are used to um take the the pictures for the whole uh borders also communication uh tools um that are used to intercept calls and uh this situation so uh there there are different uh objectives hisbah is putting in front of them aside from the war in Gaza aside from the idea of relieving Gaza from the uh pressure and trying to draw more enforcements to the north we can see now after around two weeks or less a bit less than that from the beginning of these uh uh these escalations and this war till the moment the ground the ground offensive hasn't start and this was one of the of the objectives of hisbah to prevent the ground the ground offensive and it seems still the moment the northern front is succeeding in kind of hurdling the ground offensive Ali thank you very much for all of that even as we keep an eye on the Lebanon Israel border screen left and I'll keep in mind what you said at the top of your explanation that the Israel Lebanon border is on fire and it's true that since this conflict began on October 7th uh this round of fighting there has been tit fortat exchange of uh artillery fire mortar fire Etc coming from both sides of the border and that's why we continue to keep a very close eye on what's happening there so far Israel signaling to rather saying to Lebanon you know warning them not to enter into a fullscale war Hezbollah has uh stopped short of that but every day you explain to us that the Border area is becoming more and more volatile Al jaaz is Ali Hashem in nura southern Lebanon thank you

right now on the borders this is the borderline I I think our colleague gra could show us this wall separates Lebanon from the Israeli territories and this is the blue line over here the whole uh developments and all the escalation was taking place and uh today earlier today hasbullah launched several guided missiles towards an his Israeli military post uh somewhere here in Arab ARA uh Village and then there was uh uh following this launch there there was a battle between the fighters ofah and the Israeli Army Israelis used also drones in hitting several targets also in hitting all the bushes surrounding uh the borders and now maybe we can walk a bit around in this area because this is on the of of DEA DEA starts from just like few meters from here maybe uh R could show us and then the Israeli artillery started hitting houses in the in the town in the village uh in DEA and on the other side in yarin another Village that's close to here and as we understood that there were uh two people injured two civilians injured a lady and a man uh however there's no reports with respect to casualties on uh both sides whether on hisbah sites or uh the Israeli side um the uh the whole incident ended however it just boosted the uh uh tension in this area and escalated more and more the situation whereas people are now asking more and more whether this is a beginning of a of a series of attacks and uh with with Lebanon now becoming an operation area will this drag Lebanon into the conflict and take this conflict into a kind of a a new dimension all right Ali Hashim we really appreciate the perspective that you're giving us right up at the border where trouble broke out good reporting there thanks so much Ali Hashim let's bring in Hassan Ahmed Khal he's a Lebanese economic reformist and political analyst who specializes in Middle East Affairs joins us now from London good to have you with us so first of all let's start with the question of do you think Hezbollah will commit to fully enter this battle or do you think these rocket exchanges and bombardment exchanges we' see in the north are still simply symbolic Affairs uh I I it's very hard to predict what the Hib will do in light of circumstances without knowing the end picture in Gaza I see that the Gaza front is only uh another front in third world war which had we are already people are questioning if if we are coming to Third World War I did write I say we are in the middle of it the Ukraine Russia war is one front now the Gaza and the Middle East is another front and I expect to see new fronts very soon in Africa and Asia now regarding the Lebanese border if there is if there is a new front on the Lebanese border I would be very doubtful if that front would be limited only to Lebanon to add the Gaza once the Lebanon front is open this means Syria is engaged this means Iraq and Yemen is engaged and it go it could go all the way to an all outw regional war that could involve uh Iran as well and and the Western Camp if this happens then we're talking about armadon day people think that maybe I'm over exaggerating but I think everybody is playing a dangerous game I think everybody is squeeze against a in a wall or in a corner and is looking for a corridor to to you know in order to ease the tension and on one front the Israelis and the Western Camp uh are in a position where they think that should they should recover what has been considered a big blow in light of the Gaza offensive on the other front as well nobody can afford from the camp of what we call the resistant movements in order to see that this uh attack on Gaza could continue endlessly without doing something the only question here is to what extent that people can watch uh to what level they can see destruction in Gaza before certain trigger could escalate into an overall Regional war in answering to your question I don't think Lebanon front will flare up without dragging the whole region into a an outright Regional War given what you've said then if this is possibly if not likely to turn into a much larger war that really then takes the question to what do the main powers in either Camp as you put it want have they really thought this through have they made their decisions what's your analysis listening to the statements coming out from the major powers in in both camps listening to what the US president said last night listening to the statements coming out from on the other side from Iran from heah I can tell you simply both both camps as I said are squeezed and as in the Ukraine Russia War at the beginning of this War I did come with the conclusion that if both both camps in the Ukraine Russia War come to reason and logic and say we can be both Camp could be out of this war as win-win situation we could have resolved it a year ago now similarly in Gaza front now or the middle east region in general both camps cannot hope for a win-win situation anybody who thinks that can come out of such a violent uh you know confrontation can come out with a as a winner I think is simplifying and underestimating the circumstances The best scenario is to come out of this camp for both camps is to come up out as no lose no lose the win-win situation is out of question now the best scenario is no lose no lose how do we come out with this scenario of no lose no lose if everybody allows of both parties allow the other party to have a corridor to come to reason and say listen nobody can come as a winner out of this let's set and talk logic and let's find a resolution the only problem or deficiency I see in this is the arrogance of Excess power anybody who thinks they have Excess power that they can dictate a solution today anywhere in these conflicts be it in Ukraine Russia or Gaza or what is possible confrontation on in China Sea uh is foolish I think the world is the world I say it categorically the world is living the most dangerous moments since World War II and the world now is in a polarization formation exactly similar to that that happened before first world war and second world war the world is in desperate need of wise people logical people reason to come back the the the mentality of force and enforcing the power of force will only lead that we could come to potential nuclear danger all right thank you for your uh analysis of the situation thank you sir"}, "H5kzH8DzqXc": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5kzH8DzqXc", "video_id": "H5kzH8DzqXc", "description": "Israel is fighting on two fronts.

attack in response the Israeli Army has shelled lebanon's border and set up a four colomet long buffer zone let's join our correspondent Ali Hashim who's at the AA asab in Lebanon uh so Ali tell us more about what's been happening you understand there's some activity now well we are currently on the road between and Al which is a long road uh there are um today witnessed five attacks from the Lebanese side on the Israeli side so and now we can see a lot of retaliation going on um we can hear that very very clearly especially in this this area especially in this okay I think you can you can hear the the sounds maybe of the explosions we certainly can yes it's coming through think there are right now Rockets being launched from Lebanon towards Israel and Ali this is all part of the the tit forat that's going on Israel does one thing Hezbollah does another does another is that right well in fact today as I said there were five attacks Israelis were retaliating heah then retaliating to the retaliation escalation situation is escalating gradually but darly because I mean o over the past seven days there were attacks but this is the first day that we see this amount of attacks uh happening and at the same time um while there is an Israeli kill killed in uh Shula as reported now we're hearing that the fifth heah attack when heah uh attacked an an Israeli military vehicle near hanita on the Israeli side there is there are five uh casualties now we don't know if they're killed or injured but at least this these are the initial reports on the Lebanese side today there is one injured but the uh exchange is intensifying in a way where whereas every one is currently concerned uh to what extent this is going to slide into the bigger conflict you know the uh uh uh situation here is is is too much linked I mean it's it's or organically linked to what's happening in Gaza but first of all it was kind of analyze that this is just an adjacent or a a kind of attempt to relieve the pressure from Gaza but right now with the intensif with with in intensified attacks from the Lebanese side and the retaliation from the Israeli side it seems this is getting out of control gradually now we're talking about after seven days of exchanges uh 13 were killed on the Lebanese side five from hisbah three from Hamas two from Islamic Jad most importantly three civilians including one of our colleagues Abdullah who was killed day before yesterday uh so uh things are kind of not being uh controlled anymore and that's why we're seeing even the Diplomatic attempts to try isolate this situation in in Lebanon to try to contain this situation in Lebanon Iranian foreign minister uh then some uh uh connection links and and attempts to to discuss the way how to contain lebanon's uh uh situation but it seems that the more the days are passing and and the more these attacks are happening and the retaliation is taking place the more things are getting out of control so today as I said just five attacks in one day and these attacks are linked to each other they're not I mean each one was a retaliation to to the another right so things are escalating now the first attack that hisbah launched was part of retaliation yeah if things are escalating now and this is before any ground Invasion what about if and when that happens do we anticipate this to escalate further where you are on this northern border well clearly the the tension on the nor nor Northern borders of this or my sou Southern borders is kind of limited to this line to the 120 kilometers of border between Lebanon and Israel what in case things went to a different situation especially with respect to Gaza we've not seen yet hisbah launching missiles towards cities in Israel and this this could be a very a very huge uh uh uh development because this would mean taking the whole confrontation into a different perspective into the different dimension so this is still not we're not we're not there yet but in case things deteriorate to this uh situation then we're going to see Rockets being launched from Lebanon towards Israeli cities we're gonna see Israeli air strikes on Lebanese cities and things actually will go into a war a real war and if heah is into this war then we're we're talking about a semi- regional War that's that's the least to say all right Ali we'll leave it there for the moment Ali hasham thanks very much indeed they're on the northern border of the Lebanon and Israel at first day Ali was saying the Rockets have been seen on this scale in the past week uh since that attack of last week"}, "GIePMOhUd6w": {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIePMOhUd6w", "video_id": "GIePMOhUd6w", "description": "Al Jazeera's Zeina Khodr reports from Beirut on another targeted strike

a member of the Armed group was killed in the Border Town of kafar shba we have correspondents in Israel and Lebanon to talk about these developments lur Khan is standing by in Sasa in Northern Israel but first let's go to Zena she's live for us in the Lebanese Capital Zena what more are you hearing about this latest Israeli attack in southern Lebanon well another targeted strike another member of the Lebanese armed group hasbalah killed he was in a house in the village of farba which is very close to the Border this was a overnight strike he would be the sixth member of the group to have been killed in the past 48 Hours among them a senior field commander now this is not the first time we've seen uh similar attacks in the past three and a half months since this conflict along the border began we've seen Israeli drone strike stes Target cars carrying Hezbollah members we've seen Israeli strikes on homes belonging to Hezbollah members but as of late in the past few days we're seeing um the frequency there's there's more more of these attacks and they seem to be more targeted and the Very fact that Israel actually named the person it targeted in the attack at the funeral of that senior commander on Wednesday means they are hunting down members of the group this is an intell Ence War Israel definitely relying on the drones its drones are in the skies 24/7 and they're also relying on Intelligence on the ground and what we understand from people close to Hezbollah is that there's you know there's concern about this that there are you know people on the ground giving or passing this information uh to the Israelis no doubt this is an escalation many people you talk to in Lebanon believe we are going to see more targeted assassinations we saw high-profile killing just last week Hamas is number two Sal Al aruri in down in the southern suburbs of Beirut now while all this seems to be an escalation the bottom line is both sides are still going after military targets Israel targeting hezbollah's infrastructure hezbollah's Fighters and when Hezbollah retaliates it's still focusing its attacks on Military basis but no doubt uh the situation is worrying it is escalating but you know so far to a large extent um it is it's it's still contained if you like Zena thank you very much for that Zena with the latest live in Beirut let's head now to Laura Khan she's joining us from Sasa in Northern Israel and Laura Israel's Health Ministry has ordered hospitals in the country's North to prepare for the possibility of receiving huge numbers of injured people why well when they're preparing for the possibility of receiving uh they say many soldiers injured they're saying in the thousands this means they're also preparing for a war they've so far been doing this kind of tip fortat border exchange of fire now they're talking about thousands of possible casualties so uh the Khan Israel's broadcasting um agent she said the Ministry of Health has put a directive into the hospitals to evacuate some of the non essential care patients to prepare for more to come in this is a directive so far we don't know how long this is going to happen into the future uh but they've also the Ministry of Education has said that children whove been evacuated from some of these border communities may not be able to return until the summer so they're expecting for it to take to go on for at least until the summer now I'm just going to show you exactly where I am and why this is important it's a village called sassa and if I just step behind you can see this Village it had a few hundred people in there it's now being evacuated completely there are soldiers living in the house and it's a closed military zone it's been one of the hottest areas since the war and and if the cameraman could just show you on that Ridge that's where Lebanon is about 2 kilm away we're also very close to a place called Mount meon so if we can just slowly swing the camera around this was an air control base that was hit by a barrage of Rocket fire on Saturday there at least uh Israel says at least 14 Rockets it took them a good day to even admit that it was fired upon it's just behind me up here and it's the highest point in the mountains and it's because it's a deeply sensitive area now Israel did say that it does have backup and that the damage caused there can be prepared but it was also hit yesterday in a place not far from where we were in s effort um and again Israel's Northern command unit they said there wasn't much damage uh there were no injuries but it really goes to show that the language of war is being R ramped up and we're looking at more than tit fortat at the moment between both sides but it seems so far that as Z said it is only military areas that are being targeted by Hezbollah at the moment Laura thank you very much for that that's Laura Khan with the situation in Northern Israel she's live in Sasa would"}, "WX2jsha6RuY": {"url":

We  do   continue  to  follow  this   breaking. development here.  over  the last  few hours.   That  is  Israel. Confirming   that  a senior  Hamas.

I want  to  talk   more about  the war itself.  Mark  Chandler  is   a professor of  practice  at   Coastal,  Carolina,  University  and joins us   live to talk  more about   all of  this. Thank you so   much as always  for taking   the time to be here.  You're   welcome.  Josh, and  thanks for  having me today.   Always  so  first off,   I want  to  get your  take   on  the significance  of   that. Egypt,  that Gaza  border  opening temporarily  yesterday to  allow the  transport of   humanitarian Aid. What  is   the significance of that   move? Well, Josh, I think  that's  very  significant  in the fact that  it's   going to  allow.   humanitarian  assistance  to   get into  the Palestinians   to  need  that. And I think  it shows  also  the  Diplomatic  efforts playing  behind  the scenes,  especially  from  the  Egyptian side.  and what  the  US  has done  to help move   those supplies  in  an   open that Crossing. So   that's  critical  in  that   regard. However,  I'd like   to  caution to  viewers in   the fact that we  need  some   sort  of  verification.  process that  Hamas doesn't  skim off. some of these  supplies  for their own  needs.  Its historically,  Known that  Hamas has been   since its Inception.  taking   un relief supplies. A lot of   monetary  aid from  the EU   and the UN  and even the  US   and skimming  that  off.  So   if  this  is  true   humanitarian  assistance, and  the Palestinian population   needs that  to  some  regard,  we  need  to make sure  Hamas  doesn't take  make  away   from  them. and one thing  that's  interesting to  note   is that overnight,  I would  say,  within  the last  few  hours,  we  did get that   breaking  detail that the  senior  Hamas Commander  one of  them  had been   killed  as  a result  of   that  air strike. We have  seen  some of the images   that  are coming  in  out of   that  area, is  it   significant when  you do   hear that?  A senior  Hamas  Commander has been  taken out  Yes,  it  actually  is   and this is part of what  the  Israeli Defense Forces  need   to  do. so  as  they   prepare for that  ground   assault,  we  have  to  take   out the commanding  control  aspects in the  leadership   and those who play  in this.   Invasion  this  attack   is terrorist  attack  against  Israel. So  in taking this   out,  at  tells me  a couple   of  things, one Israeli  intelligence  is  getting its  feet  underneath  them   Pretty  solidly to  be  able   to  track these Hamas  leaders,  And we  need to  take  them  out.  in a  way  that  takes away. Hamas  is ability  to  command  and control and move   their forces  around  as  his  real  prepares  to go in   the ground. So  that's   significant.  they've taken  out some  other leaders  and they're going to   continue. this. process.  if   you will  for the next   several days. if  not weeks.   this  is a  question that I  ask you every time  you're   on, but people are getting   and of  bits  and pieces  of,  what's going  on. We  have   some  people  watching  us   right now who have  not  necessarily been  following  each  and every piece of   this. Can you break down? How  we  got to  this  point  where we  are entering   during week 3 of this war  between Israel and  Hamas.   Well, if  I go  back, let's  look  at  October 7th and we   and we  see 7th significant  surprise attack that   Thomas pulled off.  against  Israel. Now,  I say  significant because Hamas had  never done  anything  at this  level.  This  scope,  this   deep  to go in  there and  kill  that  many  Israeli  citizens  at  one time   in One  Singular  type  of   attack, So  we  look at that   and then  we  have  to  back   it  up. for for I think  decades,  if  you will  since  the 1948  Inception when   Israel  became   a nation state. Tate.  they've been  fighting. the  Arabs,  The Palestinians   Hamas.  terrorist group since  that  time, and the objective  of  all those organizations  is  to  wipe  Israel  off the  face  of  the Earth.  So,  looking at  that, in the   defensive posture,  that   Israel has  you have  to   realize they  maintain that  to  have  to  maintain  that   posture.  Israel  did for the  last  I would say 30  years  try to  coexist peacefully   peacefully  with the   Palestinian people. Hamas  undercut  that  Hamas came   and took  control of  Gaza   Back in about 07, 08, And  when  they  took  control,   number  one,  they  don't  really  have  governing.  in   their Mantra. If  you will,  they  that's  not Hamas  is gone.   I'm also his goal is to wipe.  Israel  out.  Kill  all the  Jews. And so  when  we  move   forward,  Israel, trying  to   work  peacefully  with the   Palestinians, obviously,  has  failed  in  the regard  of   what  the Hamas has been   able  to. work  deeply   within  and continue to  attack  Israel. It's  a very   complicated situation.  and  I think Israel  has Pride.   recently  to  really  work   with  the Palestinian people   Hamas.  refuses to  allow  that  and we  are getting  these.  developments  pretty   much  on. I would almost  say  an  hourly  basis a lot of   information coming  in  very   quickly do  we  know  at this  point,  do we know  any more   about how Hamas was able to  carry off an  attack  like   this  one?  Because that's   been  a question  since the  get-go  Do we really  know   anything  more  than  we  did  two weeks ago?  now? That's  an  excellent question. Josh   and a couple  of  things. One  Hamas showed  detailed   planning  in the  level of   what  we  call. operational.   Security. And even   communications  security   knowing how Israel  collects   its intelligence. So  they   showed  excellent planning   and background, and I have   to  say this  planning  and  detailed. way that  they   approach  this. they  is  a  sure sign of  outside help   from  Hezbollah.  and from   Iranian revolutionary,   guards  chord. So we  look at  that. Do  we  know  exactly  how know, and I think it's a   little  bit too early.   probably  to try  to  stop   and assess  that  Israel  and  the United  States  need to  focus on  the threat  today  and the threat  going forward  at  some   point, we're going to  You need  to  look  at  that.  We  talked about it in   class.  in  regards to  an   intelligence  failure.  And  we  know  that  intelligence   isn't going to get  this   right all the time. However,   laying blame  at  this  time,  I don't really  want to do. I  don't think it's  we  should   do  that   at this time because  it's   not just  an  intelligence   failure.  it can  be  what   the military  wants to  focus  on  and it can  be  our  policy  makers  setting our  objectives  and priorities   for.  So  I think there's a  little bit  of  blame to go  around. but probably  a  little  bit too early to do  that. Just  recognize that   this  surprise. was You  talked  a little  bit about  Hezbollah they're over  in   Lebanon,  what  role  does.  Hezbollah play   in all of this  and what  is   Hezbollah?  Well. Hezbollah.   is  one a terrorist  organization. It's a   recognized  terrorist  organization. funded   supported and completely  by   Iran. and it's it has  actually  started to  gain   some  governance  traction   within  Lebanon itself. and  they  pretty much rule  the  southern  part  of Lebanon.  Now their objective also  is   to  destroy their but Josh,  if  I could,  I'd like  to   pull  this  back  a little   bit from  just  Hezbollah.   and talk  about Iran. I don't  think.  we  understand   completely  how Iran  is   all.  involved  in  this.  you know, Hezbollah is  an   Iranian backed  organization.  It's  funded  it's  supplied   militarily. completely  by   Iran. Now,  when  we  look at  that, let's see what  else   Iran is doing.  We  know   Iran  has supported Hamas.   Us  since its Inception.  I  think right now,  what  we   see coming  out of   Washington, a little  bit of   hesitancy by  the  intelligence Community  is   they're looking for that   Smoking Gun.  If  you will.  that  bruise  here  on  was  behind  this  attack. It   may take  some  time  to   find  that, but I can tell   you but personal  experience.  personal  analysis. that   prior to this attack, I can  give  you 100%  assurance.   that  Iran supported  Hamas.   and so  we  look at that, But  let's look  further at   what Iran is doing. Not only   do  they  support Hezbollah  let's look  at  the cruise   missiles  and the attack   uavs  that  came  out of   Yemen the other day That   one of  our destroyers  shot   down  in  the Red Sea.  the  houthis,  were  are  completely  supported by   a rock there  another proxy  force and they help.  Fight  against Saudi Arabia. in that  war over  the last  10 years.  So  when I  look at that  and  I know  that  the houthis  for in fact, do not have  the  technical capability. that   have  cruise  missiles  or   attack  uavs. We  saw over   time  Iranian revolutionary  guards, Corps forces  in   their training  and  supplying the houthi  forces.  And I would venture to say   if the  intelligence   Community looks closely at   this, there were  likely   Iranian advisers. near  the  launch  sites.  for those  cruise  missiles  and attack   uavs. So  you see that   aspect  one?  And then  now  let's look  at  the  US forces.  coming  under  attack  in  Iraq  Those are  all Iranian back militia   forces  inside.  Iraq. As a matter of  fact,  it's  been  that way  since  I was there in  2003.  on the in Vishal  Invasion.  And so  we  know  where Ron  is  in  there and if  they   can try to  bleed us  a  little  bit believe the  Americans they're going to   do  that  one of the  biggest  forces  in  Iraq  is  khatib.  Hezbollah.  funded  and  guided  by  Iran. So  you  have  this  entire  region   with  Iran, pushing and they   with  to  keep  everybody off  balance and and try to   at least  at this time, keep   Israel  where it  cannot   focus solely on the south.   and Hezbollah continue. What   I call  harassing although   their deadly  harassing  attacks,  coming from the  north,  Hezbollah has 100,000  Fighters. better  trained  than  the Hamas and up to I  would say 50,000 rockets and   missiles. that  can  rain Terror down  all across   Israel. We  saw that.  hospital. explosion,  several  days  ago,  where Israel   said  that  it  was Hamas at   fault or  another Palestinian  Terror. organization  and you  did have, of course Hamas.   That  said, Israel  was  responsible.  what  sort of  role  does  that  play? in   complicating  matters as  the  war is  underway  because the  information came  out pretty   quickly and it  was kind of  the blame game  at  first and  then  you had President Biden  come  out and say look   Israel  was not at fault   Here's the  evidence. what   sort of complication  this   did that  cause Well,  first off,  that's  a tragic   loss  of  life. and I hate   to see  that  anywhere.  But when  we  look at it  in   the context of  warfare,  and  is, particularly  this  war,   that's taking place.  I think  what  you saw in. In  a  modern  society is  how  social media. is  being used.  to  spread. various  information bad information  that's  going out there and  the propensity  for for  populations around   the world.  to  just  buy  into that.  I also  see this   as  a microcosm of  Iranian  Hezbollah and Hamas.   information and So   they're going to  act fast,  they're going to  go  very   quickly with  information and  they're going to  blame  Israel  on  any.  negative   aspect that takes place out  there.  I think what  you saw  is the  Israelis  knew  they   didn't have any aircraft   in the  air and knew  they   weren't having  a strike  And  so  they  were  able  to   quickly come  out and  say that  that's  not going  to  appease.  folks.  who are  predisposed to  go  out  there and blame Israel. and  It's  an  information warfare  that's  being played   very well by  Iran, Hezbollah  Hamas.  So, we're going to   see more  incidents like   this. Israel's  following the  laws  of  armed conflict   if you  will, the  international agreements.  Hamas is a  terrorist  organization  and it's not   So  the more  that  they   continue to use neighborhoods  mosque  hospitals for their  military  purposes. They are   taken away. the opportunity  to  play  fair. If  you will   and war is not fair.  But  at least  Israel is trying   to  abide by  all those laws   of  armed conflict. that  are  internationally recognized   the terrorist organization   President Biden was in.  Israel. Just  a few days   ago.  He  was there and met  with  Israeli  Prime Minister Netanyahu. He   met with  some  other  officials there and he  spoke  to  address.  essentially  Israel  and the world to   show  that  the u.s.  does   stand with  Israel. We've  also  seen  Secretary of   State Antony  blinken go   over  There  Two different times I believe  at this point.  over. one  week  period, we've also   seen  US senators like  Chuck  Schumer there and we  have   more  US  senators  that are   there,  right now.  Now,   they're going to  speak  going to speak coming up in about an hourwhat   does that say about the u.s.   involvement in  this  ongoing  war between Israel and   Hamas?  Well, well, Josh,  let me  step  out of  being  an  intelligence  officer and  talk  to  you.  I believe  that's  that's  positive. My   opinion,  is. that's   positive  Support that  that   we're showing for the only   democratic  government  in   the Middle East and and our  support is  vital to  that   in  support of  our national   interest. But Stepping   a little  bit further is, we   don't see any strategic.   appreciation  by  this   Administration. I wrote about  that  a couple  of  years ago  There's there's a lack  of   understanding of  the global   environment and the threats  that  exist to  you.  States   and its allies. So  I hope   that  this  diplomatic   effort  and  that this diplomatic  as   someone.  who's fought  in   Wars. We  don't want  to  go   and get into  a war but we   must  be  prepared  to  do   so  a strong  diplomatic   push. is  what  we  need.  We've got the Gerald  are for  their,  we  moved the  Marine Expeditionary  Unit   Two 26th   Marine Expeditionary  Unit   there to be prepared  for  different missions. We  are  putting  high altitude area defense.  That's  overnight development  that  that are  going to go  to the  Middle East.  but we   Need  to  allow those  forces to protect.   themselves  and  our interest in the  Middle East.  I hope  that   this  Administration   wakes up  to  the threat   that  Iran  is   orchestrating.  behind the   scenes  across  the  Middle East as a  threat   to the  United States.   I hope  that  the  administration  allows   those forces  to  do   their mission and to  do, and  our interest there  that  the  jury still out  in  my   opinion.  Josh, and I'm  going to  ask a loaded   question  here, But you know,  we  talked  about this  a few  weeks ago,  Do  you see any  end in sight? to  this  war  between?  Israel and  Hamas?   We  know, to  American   hostages  were released but  there are still more  than   200 other hostages  that   have  been  taken by  Hamas  at  this  point,  Is  there  any end in sight  to  any of   this? Well. touching on the  hostages, I think that   was great that  we  had  two Americans released   There's about 210  hundred and ten hostages   still held  captive Israelis   other Third Country Nationals  in  US  citizens. what  I  think.  Tomas is  doing and I  go  back  to my information  Warfare.  is   they're playing on  public   opinion.  and there also,  trying  to  stall off that   ground attack.  from  the  Israeli Defense Forces. So   if  they  can Triple  A few  hostages  out,  I think  that's  a positive   development.  to  get those  hostages. obviously.  But  a negative  development.  to   try.  to  create   - public opinion  against  Israel  doing anything   on the  ground. Let's not  forget. Hamas,  went  in   two weeks ago.  and  slaughtered 14. 100 Israeli  citizens. capture these  two hundred-plus. civilians.   So  while it  might be  a  nice  gesture to  release  them, let's not forget  that   first.  they  captured  them   so  I think that's  a  balance that's  going to   play  out in  at some point.   Israel  is  going to  have   pay to take action  because  Moss does not action because   best  interest  of  these  hostages. in  mind  at all.  Mark Chandler,  as  always.  Thank you so  much  for  taking  the time  to  join   us  and help  break down  a  very, very  complicated  subject here. Is  there  anything  you want to add  anything  that  I didn't  ask  before  I let you go?  Josh, I think you had some   great times.  I don't think I  addressed how long  this  is   going to take.  But when  we   look back the the last  time   in  2006, when  Hezbollah  thought that was  34  days.  in  2021, that  was 11  days.  We're at  15  days  or  20   days. 15  days  now.  So   we're looking a Unger  involvement at  this, And  then just one final personal   comment,  if  I met Josh,  you know, tomorrow  is  the  40th  anniversary.  of  the  Beirut  Barracks  bombing we   had Am you  there?  And we   lost  241 service lost  that   day 221 of them,  my  Marine   Brothers, And I just  want to  say that, Hezbollah,  was  responsible for that  attack.  that  tragic  attack   and they  were  back   solely by Iran  and it  was  instigated  and planned by   Iran. So I  just  bring that   up  for a little  context and  little  personal  history.   of  what  takes place in   this  region  and the type of  people   Now that we're facing.  All  right,  Mark Chandler.  Thank  you again for taking  the  time  to be.  here. We   really  appreciate it.   Thank you, Josh.

There's been   a lot of  talk  about  possible  deals on  the table  to  release the remaining  more  than  100 hostages   that  are still being held   by  Hamas at  this  hour  the  Washington  Post  now  reporting details of the   latest  proposed  deal  to   which we  are told  that   Israel  has broadly agreed   and Hamas is  considering  again all of  this.  negotiation still underway   at  this  point.  This  would  include a 6 pause in the war   with  with Israeli  forces   withdrawing from  populated  areas of  Gaza  as  well  as   a big boost to  humanitarian.  Aid I want to talk  about  this  and other topics  here.  So  let's bring in  aiv Ezra   the acting  Consul general   of  Israel. in  New York   joining us  now live.  Thank you so much for taking   the time. to  be  here  with   us  today.  thank you so much  for having  me  again.   All right,  Well  first off I  just  want to get your   thoughts  overall because I  mentioned this  but over  the  past  couple  months  here   we've heard.  several  possible  deals that   have been on the  table  to get  the rest  of  the  hostages  released. Does  it   appear  that  we  are any  closer  to  a deal  actually   being uh  made  here  and  those hostages. being  released. well  after the  atrocities  of  October 7 as   we  have  discussed in  the  past. are 2 goals.  were  as   follows first of all  to   make  sure  that  this  does   not happen  again,  but the  second  of  course  which is   not less  important is  to   bring back  our hostages   originally  there were  240  and the first release of   hostages. We  did everything   we  can to  make  sure  that   we  can create  a situation  where they  come  back  home   at  this  point we  have   about 136 and we  work  very   closely with  our allies   like  the United  States  of   America.  but also  with  the  mediators like  Qatar and  Egypt that  have  a direct   line  with  Hamas to  make   sure  that  we  bring back   our hostages  alive today  sooner  rather  than  later  now the idea  is  that  we   will  Embrace any opportunity  to  do  that  either  in   diplomatic  measures  and  this  is  uh, the Diplomatic   path  that  I've  described  right now.  but also  we   understand  that  without  beefing the military   pressure. Hamas will   actually  not move  forward  in  a deal  like  that. They   are not humanitarian  they   have  not  become humanitarian.  and the  only  way to  get them  to   make  that  deal  is  when   they  understand. that. their  life  is  on the  threat  and  that's  why we are  beefing.   parallel  to  the Diplomatic   pressure. We're beefing also   the military  pressure  in   the southern  part  of  us.  and you kind of touched on   this  already,  but just   kind of explain to me the US   involvement in  this  deal   because we  know  that   Qatar is  uh  very  much   involved  in  this  but what   about the US overall? We're  very  grateful  for our uh   us  partners  strategic  partners  for being involved   in  this  first of all,  because there are US citizens  towards Israelis  and Jews,  but there are also  towards  US citizens There are about  30  of them that  were   butchered and they were  around  10 of them  that   were  abducted  so  the  United  States  also,  of course.  focusing  on  US   citizen,  but also  in  the  understanding that  if  we   do  not get and I refer you  if  we  do  not get our  hostages  back  home  safely.  they  will not  be  an   ending  to  this. Uh, uh, uh,  uh  military  campaign  and  um  and in  this  sense we   are highly  appreciated.   both  to  the administration   and from  the president.   through secretaries of  the  state secretaries of  defense  National  Security  adviser.   They're all  very interesting to me  and  assisting us  to  reach out  to  players like  Qatar that   they  unfortunately were  uh,  for many  years very  close  to  Hamas and now they  are  the only  Channel that   really  can make  a  difference  in  bringing   these hostages  back  we   will  once  again Embrace  every opportunity to  make   it  happen  and we  want to  make  sure  that  parallel   to  that  of course.  we   will  make  a  differentiation.  between  commas, which is  um,  Monster is  killing machine  in  between the innocent. Uh   civilians that  are there.   How has the US  relationship   with  Israel? changed over   the past  several months   since the war did break out  back? on  October 7th. How   has the relationship  between  the 2?  changed?  has it   changed?  you know  we   don't see anything. between  Israel and the United  States when it comes to the  Goals,  we  just  first.   eradicating kamasu   capabilities  meaning we   don't want  to make we   want to make  sure  that   their they  do not  have  the  ability to  go  after us   again because we  know  they   have  the the willingness.   They  would like  to. go   after us. again in  their  words again and again and  again.  we  need  to   make sure that  we  deprive  their military  capabilities   of  doing that. and second.  Of  course  agreed  with  the  fact  that  we  want to bring  the hostage. So there's no   daylight  in  the  Strategic goals with   the United  States  in   Israel. and when  I'm here   also  in  New York. I meet   also. uh  members of   Congress  US senators we  see  a bipartisan  bicc  camera   support for that  We  see it   on  the state level.  I'm I'm  I've had  amazing  interactions  with  Governors  here  the governor  of  New  York  the governor  of  New  Jersey  the governor  of   Pennsylvania. Governor  of   Ohio. They're all strongly   in support of Israel's  right  for self-defense  and Beauty   for self-defense  and also   the municipal level.  1 of   The Amazing leaders.  here   is  the mayor of  of   New York  city  that  has  come. very  strongly  in   support of  Israel's. and  right for self-defense. and  we  know  that  Israel  has  placed  these allegations  against some  of  the  employees actually  a large  amount  of  employees that   are part of the unrwa.   and the US  has cut its  funding and so  have  several  other countries,  too.  uh   that  organization  there  what  does  that  say to  you  about the US? stance  and the  other country stance  on   where things  stand there in   the Middle  East?  Un is a un organization.   and the fact  that  we  have.  a substantially improved   that. their personnel have   been  involved  in  that   atrocities  including and not  limited to  but including a  storming  our communities  including uh, supporting   that  atrocities  including  holding kidnapped.  Uh, uh   hostages. It  is  truly  mind-boggling that  a un   staff that  is  under the  payroll of  the UN  is   committing an taking  part   of  of  humanitarian  of  of   a uh  of  a crimes  against  humanity. It's  really   mind-boggling.  So  what  we   have  done  is  we  have   said  these documented   proofs  to the  US  and to   many  other countries around   the world that  are supported  in the unra and uh  both   United  States  both  the UK.  Canada. Australia.  Italy,   Italy have  actually  decided  to  withdraw  that  the  support for unra  because  it's  once  again  unbelievable. and graspable  and unimaginable  that  you  and uh  teams that  are under  the payroll of  the UN  are  committing  these crimes   against humanity. I want to  get by  the way,  these are  not just  just  not brought  to  an  Apple this  this  has  to be a full  reform  because  this  is  not just  a a  pinpoint  of  the few  examples, but there are more.  uh  that  uh  illustrate  the  fact  that  we are  talking  about.  a serious problem  here. Of  course. Well, also   I want to get your  take  on   this  as  you are here  in   the US. does  it  appear   that  most? Americans do   support Israel  in  this  war  against Hamas?  Yes,  we  uh,  we  see,  uh  the post  very   clearly There's a strong   understanding of  the General  public  in the  very  very   high. and numbers of   supporting  Israel's.  a I would say War  for self-defense  War for uh   our values  there's  understanding that  we're not  fighting  just  for Israel,  but we  are actually   in Beacon of  light for the  Free  World in  a challenging  area  and therefore we  see  it  across  the board both   of  the general population.  and in  many  in  many   other,  uh  uh  segments  of   the population  We  do  have   a challenge with   the more younger  crowds. I  would say the 18  to the 24.   and my  take  on  it  is   that  we need to  do. a  the the the context of  is   very  complex and  there need to be a kind of   in  depth approach  to  it.  some  of  these uh   youngsters  are receiving  their information.  uh  from   uh  from  Tik Tok or  from   social  media.  or   50 seconds  segments  and I  think we  need to do   a better  job to  make  sure   that  these misconceptions   that  are there that  are out  there.  uh  will  be  clearer  to  them  in  terms of   understanding.  real   reality.  and on  that  same   note. what  do  you think is   the biggest?  misconception  people  out there have  about  the war overall.   1 of the biggest  that  we   deal  with  is  the fact   that  people  were  thinking   that  Israel. October 6th has  occupied  Gaza, but those who  know  their history know   that  in. 2005. Israel   has unilaterally  disengaged   from  the Gaza  suit. meaning  that  October 7th when  they   attacked  us  there was no   occupation  there.  There was  no  settlements there were   no  even  1 single  soldier  So  that's  a huge   misconception.  that  the  second  1, is that  when   you know, we  see these uh,  1 of  these,  Uh, uh,  demonstrations  that   happened  next  to  our  consultant.  Actually they happened October 8 way before  the military   campaign  and we  hear  these  chants  down  there.  of   people  that  I think best   case  scenario. are not  educated  worst case scenario  you do  mean  what  they  say  when  they  call. from  the  river To  The Sea Palestine  will  be  free  which is   actually  a genocidal.  cry  against.  the mere  existence  of  Israel. It's  not about  policy. It's  not about  differentiation in  politics.  It's  about the fact  that   they  want  Israel   eradicated  of the map. So   I hope  that  people  in   this  sense in  the best   case  scenario  as  I said   don't really  understand   which river and which sea  they  need  to be.  more   educated  on  that  but worst  case  scenario  if   they really mean  it. These  are genocidal acts   regardless  of  what  we do.   It's  not about what  we do.   It's  about Who We  Are  All right,  Aviv, Ezra   their acting  Consul general   of  Israel  in  New York.  Thank you so  much  as   always  for taking  the time.  to  join  us  be  here  with   us. and break down  some   of the  latest  headlines of   the war.  Is  there anything   else  that  you want  to  add  here  before? I let you go.  Thank you so much for  continuously  educating.   Uh, uh  your  viewers and the  most  important thing for us   is  to  make  sure  that  we   will  not in  any way shape  or  form  give  up  until we   bring back  our hostages  and  until we  make sure that   these atrocities  will  not  happen  again.  All right.   Thank you again for taking   the time  to  be  here  with   us  this  morning.  We   appreciate  it.

international law aler spoke to two men about what they went through I was at home when the Army stormed my house I told them I'm sick and I can't move they took me out of my house and put me in an armored vehicle I thought at the beginning they would take me to a hospital but instead they took me to Israel I spent 10 days in Israel where they hit me insulted me and humiliated me every day I feel pain everywhere on my body they forced us to bend on our knees for hours they kept asking me about the tunnels and about their captives held by Hamas I told them I'm 70 years old and I know nothing about these matters they hit me a lot when I couldn't find an answer to their questions I swear to God that I didn't have a single drop of water for days it was the worst 10 days of my life when we got an evacuation warning we left our place and headed towards the sea the moment we arrived at the security checkpoint the Israeli soldiers kidnapped us we weren't even given a chance to ask any questions we spent the first 3 days without food or water we were not allowed to go to the toilets we were beaten harshly all over the first 3 days after that they moved us to another place for some new methods of torture after a 3day starvation they gave us a meal that's not even enough for a child in the prison you're allowed to sleep in the yard where the weather's very cold and where you have only a very thin mattress and very wet blanket the Israeli soldiers didn't stop beating us insulting us and swearing at us all the time in the studio by Al jazer senior political analyst marn Bashar Marin I think we need to pause and uh take stock of what we've just heard from hany there because obviously this is a conflict in which we've all seen horror upon horror but what we've been reporting in the past 24 hours appears to be allegations of systematic torture extrajudicial educ executions about bodies wrapped in plastic thrown in in Shallow Graves I mean what does this say about the kind of War that's been waged by Israel and Gaza I think we've arrived at the Abu moment u in Gaza where the actual physical torture and humiliation uh physical violence and so on so forth is finally exposed so there's Revelations now more and more of them accumulating after months of war the gazans the Palestinians in Gaza have been subjective to a number or different types of violence right so for a long time it was The Siege and uh over over the past four months the sieg me started starvation it meant denial of basic human rights especially to children and to mothers and fathers and so on and that's a very particular silent implicit kind of violence then there was the bombing the bombing from the air artillery bombing from the sea but that was the kind of bombing that you do from a distance right it's very very hurtful very destructive very bloody but it's from Far you're a pilot you're you're Manning an artillery shell or whatever and then there is a psychological violence right the psychological violence the terror the drones scaring people and what have you and then there's this violence the primordial violence the Primitive violence the physical violence the torture the Abu type violence that's been exposed where Israeli soldiers are physically personally psychologically invested in torturing Palestinians in this in the kind of sadism in the kind of hurtful humiliating sadism against the Palestinians as if it goes beyond the Revenge of a primordial time as if it goes beyond defense Beyond offense beyond beyond racism it goes to something very very basic instinctive I would say animalistic approach to another human being it has been described by some as as a conflict of annihilation a war of annihilation I wonder where this evidence that we've seen accumulated over the past 24 48 Hours where that sits in the context of what has been decided at the international court of justice just uh just under a week ago today you know um I think the Israelis apparently have Lost in Translation right as if they have not understood and they're American backers as if they have not understood OD what came out from the international court of justice I mean my own interpretation I would say Israel has been indicted right there's no final verdict but they accepted the case Israel is basically officially indicted for genocide and you would think that they came out innocent because there is no ceasefire involved as if all the charges that were made and then all the the provincial measures the inter orders the icg ordered Israel in the interim to do a number of things because it's suspected of genocide but when you look at for example what they're doing in the hospitals or around the hospitals or in the hospitals like in Janine where did they disguise as doctors where they kill people in hospitals where they turn hospitals into battlefields or into targets there's something about you know turning doctors into enemies I mean I I I think for the Palestinians probably the Saints the present day Saints are the doctors and the nurses and the medical staff because they're the only ones out there at the Forefront trying to you know make the hurt go away or try try to listen the hurt of of Palestinians and as if that is angering the Israelis the most and hence there's the kind of a criminal acts you know a violation of all legality and morality by using the hospitals as battlefields or by bombing the hospitals as if they are targets they are of course meant to be places of healing marn stay with us because I also want to reflect upon some diplomatic movement that we've uh seen uh in recent days as well because katar's prime minister told National Public Radio in the US that the framework for a ceasefire with Israel is now being presented to Hamas he says indirect negotiations will take place in the coming days we cannot predict that is it going to have a breakthrough and will move forward very fast or how fast it will go it will all depends on both parties our aim is to finish this as soon as possible and to bring the hostages back but to put a closure for the war as well okay well I'm uh joined of course still by Maran Bashar is here in the studio with me so the message I think the takeaway message there was there is a degree of movement we cannot promise anything right now but tentatively discussions are happening these indirect talks are are underway is Haner um the obviously prominent Hamas figure is in Egypt being briefed what does all of this mean if we try and connect the dots well there's two ways to look at it I mean just to make it really simple one way is that this is all an attempt at creating the impression that something is happening and that America and nanah government the Biden Administration and and the Egyptians and everyone else trying to do their best in order to bring about an end to this and and to get the captives out and and and so on so forth because that buys Israel time I mean Israel now is benefiting from this whole movement to carry out its genocide that we were just talking about the torture right and then there is the other one that says look everyone is fed up uh including the Israelis the public by the war and the Palestinians certainly want to have an end to this Suffering The Americans are an election year they would like to wind it down so this interpretation says there is a good reason why all parties might be interested in at least some kind of a deal but the gap between Hamas and Israel is huge right the only way to bridge the gap is for the Americans to get in with the with the support or with the help of Qatar and Egypt and others and and give guarantees to both parties that if you sign on WE the Americans will guarantee you a number of things if the parties buy into the guarantees we could have a deal my only fear uh n my only fear is that they could reach a deal but it could break in no time Maran many thanks for your

JACKIE:  THANK YOU SO MUCH. EXCELLENT REPORTING AS ALWAYS. MEANTIME, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE CONGRESSMAN DEAN PHILLIPS GOING AFTER PRESIDENT BIDEN FOR THE AMERICAN HOSTAGES THAT ARE STILL TRAPPED BY HAMAS. HE WRITES IN PART ON X, QUOTE, IT'S UNACCEPTABLE THAT AMERICAN CITIZENS REMAIN HELD BY HAMAS AND HAVE NOT BEEN SET FREE THROUGH DIPLOMACY OR SPECIAL FORCE EXTRACTION, IT HAS BEEN OVER SIX WEEKS AND IT'S INEXCUSABLE. JOINING ME IS FLORIDA CONGRESSMAN CARLOS JIMINEZ, A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE ARMED SERVICE, HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE AND SELECT COMMITTEE ON CHINA. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. HE CERTAINLY HAS A POINT WHEN IT COMES TO AMERICANS A THAT ARE BEING DETAINED BY HAMAS. WE DON'T KNOW THE BEHIND THE SCENES CONVERSATIONS GOING ON. SO I DO UNDERSTAND THAT. HAVING SAID THAT, FOR OVER SIX WEEKS, YOU WOULD EXPECT THIS PRESIDENT WOULD BE FIGHTING A LITTLE HARDER TO GET AMERICANS BACK ON OUR SOIL. >>  YEAH, INSTEAD OF FIGHTING TO GET AMERICANS BACK, WHAT DOES THIS PRESIDENT DO? RECENTLY HE GAVE THE OKAY FOR IRAQ TO BUY $10 BILLION WORTH OF ENERGY FROM IRAN, $10 BILLION. SO LOOK, THE UNITED STATES HAS AT LEAST ECONOMIC -- IT COULD PUT ECONOMIC PRESSURE ON HAMAS' MAJOR BEN FACTOR, IRAN, AND THE START TO STARVE THEM OF THE CASH THEY NEED TO SUSTAIN HAMAS AND HEZBOLLAH AND ALL THOSE OTHER TERRORIST ACTIVITIES BUT THEY REFUSE TO DO THAT. AND SO IT'S UP TO THE ISRAELIS TO DO THE TASKS THAT AMERICA NEEDS DO FOR ITSELF OR IN CONJUNCTION WITH ISRAEL AND SO, AGAIN, THIS PRESIDENT ALL HE SHOWS IS WEAKNESS. AND FRANKLY I HAVE NO FAITH IN HIS ABILITY TO FREE THOSE AMERICAN HOSTAGES. LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE FEW. JACKIE:  I HAVE TO ASK YOU REALLY QUICK BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT TOPIC, THANKSGIVING WEEKEND, LONG WEEKEND, THE PRESIDENT HAS A HISTORY OF GOING TO NANTUCKET AND SO HE DID WITH HIS FAMILY ONCE AGAIN THIS YEAR WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE AMERICAN FAMILIES WAITING FOR HOSTAGES TO BE RELEASED AND THE AGONY AND PAIN AND SUFFERING THEY'VE BEEN DEALING WITH AS THEY'RE WAITING DO YOU THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THE PRESIDENT TO BE CELEBRATING THANKSGIVING IN THE WAY THAT HE HAS? >> WELL, NOT REALLY. HE SHOULD HAVE MORE EMPATHY FOR THE AMERICAN HOSTAGES AND THEIR FAMILIES AND SHOULD BE VIEWED AS DOING EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO GET THEM BACK, NOT REALLY VACATIONING IN NANTUCKET BUT THAT SEEMS TO BE WHAT P PRESIDENT BIDEN DOES. HE DOESN'T SPEND MUCH TIME IN THE WHITE HOUSE, SPENDS A LOT OF TIME AWAY VACATIONING. JACKIE:  WE'VE SEEN THAT, THE VACATIONS AND THE BEACH ARE A BIG PRIORITY FOR HIM. >>  YEAH. MAYBE IT'S NOT A BAD THING BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WHEN HE'S ACTUALLY DOING THE JOB HE'S NOT VERY GOOD AT IT SO MAYBE IT'S BETTER THAT HE STAYS AWAY. JACKIE:  MEANTIME, THE BIDEN HARRIS RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN POSTING WHAT THEY CALL A GUIDE TO HANDLE, QUOTE, CRAZY MAGA NONSENSE ON THANKSGIVING. HE CLAIMED TRUMP DID NOT SECURE THE BORDER. INSTEAD THEY SAY HE SEPARATED FAMILIES AND PUT PEOPLE IN CAGES, THEY WARN IF TRUMP IS ELECTED AGAIN HE WILL ROUND UP LATINOS INTO MASS DETENTION CENTERS. YOUR REACTION TO THIS. WE KNOW PRESIDENT TRUMP SECURED THE BORDER, DID WHAT HE HAD TO DO TO MAKE SURE WE DID NOT HAVE AN INFLUX OF ILLEGALS IN THIS COUNTRY, WE CAN SEE WHAT THE AFTERMATH OF LOOSE POLICY HAS BEEN, IT'S BEEN COMPLETELY DISASTROUS. YOU'VE GOT THE OTHER SIDE SPINNING IT, TRYING TO MAKE IT LOOK BAD. >>  WELL, LOOK, LISTEN, AGAIN, NEVER LISTEN TO WHAT PRESIDENT BIDEN TELLS YOU, ALWAYS WATCH WHAT HE'S DOING. IT'S PRESIDENT BIDEN WHO ACTUALLY DESTROYED OUR IMMIGRATION AND OUR SOUTHERN BORDER AS SOON AS HE TOOK OFFICE, THERE WAS A HUGE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF MIGRANTS FLOWING INTO THE UNITED STATES. IT WAS PRESIDENT BIDEN ALSO A THAT HAS AT LEAST 85,000 CHILDREN THAT WE DON'T EVEN THOUGH WHERE THEY ARE, SO TALKING ABOUT SEPARATING FAMILIES, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD THIS BORDER UNDER CONTROL. PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS ACTUALLY FOLLOWING THE LAW. PRESIDENT BIDEN IS BREAKING THE LAW AND PUTTING AMERICANS AT RISK. NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE FLOWING INTO THE BORDER THAT WE KNOW OF BUT WE HAVE CLOSE TO 2 MILLION PEOPLE WE HAVEN'T THE FAINTEST IDEA WHO THEY ARE, THE GOT AWAYS, WE DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE, DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY CAME FROM, WE DON'T KNOW THEIR INTERCHTION IN THE UNITED STATES -- INTENTION IN THE UNITED STATES SO HE'S PUTTING AMERICA AT RISK AND I BELIEVE WE WILL SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES OF PRESIDENT BIDEN'S INACTION, MALFEASANCE AT THE BORDER, NOT ONLY NOW, IN THE NEAR FUTURE BUT FOR YEARS TO COME. JACKIE:  HE'S PUTTING AMERICANS AT RISK AND IT'S A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS AT THE BORDER AS WELL. WE'VE SEEN SO MANY HORROR STORIES OF WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO CROSS IN THIS WAY. IT'S JUST -- IT'S MIND BOGGLING TO ME THAT THE ADMINISTRATION JUST TURNS A COMPLETE BLIND EYE TO IT BECAUSE IT WANTS TO HIT ITS TARGETS WITH RESPECT TO ITS OWN AGENDA BUT I WANT TO SWITCH AND TALK A LITTLE ABOUT THE JOB THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN IS DOING BECAUSE THERE'S A NEW EMERSON COLLEGE POLL, CONGRESSMAN, THAT PUTS PRESIDENT TRUMP AHEAD -- FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP AHEAD OF PRESIDENT BIDEN 47 TO 43 BEES NATIONALLY. BIDEN IS LOSING OUT WITH HISTORICALLY DEMOCRAT SUPPORTING VOTING BLOCKS, JUST 3% OF HIT PANIC VOTERS SUPPORT THE CURRENT PRESIDENT, DOWN FROM 14% LAST NOVEMBER. UNI VISION CEO IS DEFENDING THE INTERVIEW WITH THE FORMER PRESIDENT AFTER FACING CRITICISM FROM THE HISPANIC CAUCUS, WADE DAVIS SENDING A MEMO SAYING IT IS AN INDEPENDENT NEWS ORGANIZATION AND WILL NOT BE DETERRED BIPARTISAN INTERESTS AND AGENDA DRIVEN ADVOCACY. CONGRESSMAN, YOUR RESPONSE TO THIS? IT'S CLEAR THAT THE LEFT DID NOT WANT UNI VISION TO CONDUCT THE INTERVIEW BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT PRESIDENT TRUMP REACHING OUT TO MORE HISPANIC VOTERS WHO SEEM TO BE OPEN TO HEARING WHAT HE HA HAS TO -- WHAT HE THOSE SAY. >>  PRESIDENT TRUMP DID A GREAT JOB REACHING OUT TO HISPANICS. HE'S BROKEN NEW GROUND WITH HISPANIC VOTERS. HISPANIC VOTERS, WE WANT THE SAME THING. WE WANT OPPORTUNITY. WE WANT TO LIVE IN FREEDOM. WE DON'T WANT CENSORSHIP. WE HOLD THE VALUES -- A LOT OF THE VALUES OF THE REPUBLICAN .WE'RE PEOPLE OF FAITH. WE'RE PEOPLE OF HARD WORK. PRESIDENT BIDEN FAILS ON ALL POINTS. AND SO THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE THESE FAR LEFT LATINO GROUPS THAT ARE AFRAID OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S MESSAGE, SAYS IT ALL. REALLY YOU SHOULD BE OPEN TO THE MESSAGE OF ANYBODY THAT WANTS TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT AND IT APPEARS TO ME THAT THOSE GROUPS ARE JUST LOOKING TO CENSOR THE PRESIDENT, THE FORMER PRESIDENT, WHICH AGAIN RUNS COUNTER TO WHAT WE CAME HERE -- WE CAME TO THIS COUNTRY FOR WHICH IS FREEDOM, FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION. WE SEE CENSORSHIP IN THOSE COUNTRIES WHICH WE LEFT. I LEFT CUBA WHEN I WAS A YOUNG BOY SEARCHING FOR FREEDOM AND FOUND IT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES AND SO, YEAH, MORE AND MORE HISPANICS ARE GOING TO TURN AWAY FROM PRESIDENT BIDEN JUST LIKE MORE AND MORE AMERICANS ARE TURNING AWAY FROM PRESIDENT BIDEN BECAUSE FRANKLY HE'S BEEN A DISASTER AND CONTINUES TO BE A DISASTER AND WE NEVER TRUST WHAT HE SAYS. YOU WATCH WHAT HE DOES. WHAT HE DOES IS ALWAYS AGAINST AMERICAN INTERESTS WHICH IS OUR INTERESTS, HISPANIC INTERESTS ARE TIED TO AMERICAN INTEREST AND THIS PRESIDENT SEEMS TO BE HELL-BENT ON DESTROYING THE AMERICA THAT I GREW UP IN AND THE AMERICA I LOVE SO MUCH.

unrest the Netherlands turns to the radical right the anti-immigration leader who won the most seats potential perks and problems what buying the Trans Mountain pipeline could mean for indigenous groups global national with Donna FZ good evening and thanks for joining us they say the uncertainty is unbearable the relatives of the hostages held by Hamas and Gaza are hoping the deal to release them is real and that 50 of the more than 200 people held captive by Hamas will be freed starting tomorrow nearly 7 weeks after the worst massacre in Israel's history the deal starts with a pause in the fighting that's set to begin at 7:00 a.m. local time then humanitarian Aid would begin to enter Gaza and later in the day the first of the hostages expected to be women and children would be released in exchange Palestinian prisoners would be freed from Israeli jails until that happens Israel's Siege on Gaza goes on exact numbers of Deb are imposs possible to verify but the Hamas run Health Ministry now says close to 15,000 people have been killed this deal if it happens would bring the first pause in Israel's intense assault on Gaza but there is weariness tonight Israel warns there could be changes to the hostage release plan at any minute Mike Armstrong reports and a warning some of the images in his story are distressing as the clock ticks down to the temporary ceasefire the death toll continues to move up the Israeli military says it launched 300 air strikes on Gaza in the last day intensifying its pounding of targets both in the north of the Gaza Strip where it's told people to move from and in the South where it's told people to move too according to Palestinian media at least 15 were killed Thursday in conun this boy says he was in a building when it was hit he was in the bathroom fell to the floor and put his hands over his head we have just uh finished with all the communication with all uh parties qari officials say things are now set for the temporary paus and fighting starting Friday morning it was delayed a day when negotiations hit a snag over the implementation plan things were apparently worked out in meetings that went into the early morning Hamas officials have now handed over a list of hostages should be released Friday afternoon they will be 13 in number all women and uh children and uh those hostages who are from the same families will be uh put together within the same patch officials are keeping much of the agreement secret they won't say how many prisoners Israel will release Friday it's supposed to be a 3:1 exchange they also aren't saying much about how the hostages will be handed over only that the Red Cross will be involved well families of the hostages are calling on the Red Cross to be able to do more they want it given access to all the hostages of life is to allow the Red Cross to visit them and it's a disgrace that this do not happen and this must happen now most of the families of the hostages will still be waiting after the first 50 are free Noah aramani is 26 years old all her family knows is what they've seen in this video her and her boyfriend being led Away by Hamas Fighters October 7th she won't be one of the people handed over but they say they understand why this is the order it should be her father says first the children and with God's help Noah's turn will come the other major part of this deal is for Aid it's been piling up in Egypt there's no specific number of trucks that will be allowed to enter Gaza but the Qatari mediators say during the 4-day pause as many as possible will be moved in and yet they add however many it is it won't be enough the need they say is simply too great right now Donna all right Mike Armstrong in Jerusalem thank you the Israeli Army released more evidence which it says backs up its claim gaza's largest hospital served as a Hamas Command Center this IDF video shows another tunnel the Army says it starts in a house and runs underneath nearby

but it all went down I uh stay in my hotel and me me me call my husband and say Natalia I don't know when when I come back the FBI has already concluded its investigation and now it's in the hands of the Falls Police Department who are treating this as a traffic investigation as you can see some equipment has been brought in to help dismantle what remains including that checkpoint Booth two people were killed in the horrific crash prompting a swift response from authorities North and South of the Border it was a real sad uh real sad scenario husband and wife four Regional land border crossings shut down in response have since reopened we're very sensitive to those borders having just had them closed during Co and of course 9/11 is is a memory but it's not far enough away for any of us we thought oh my gosh you got to be kidding not again initially many feared this was an act of Terror that was later confirmed not to be the case I saw a report uh within an hour that spoke about the fact that the vehicle was headed um to uh the Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City clearly every video showed the vehicle had headed Westward toward Canada unless there is some method to get from Southern Ontario to New York City that I'm unaware of that's just Preposterous nonsense shalima Maharaj Global News in Quebec more than half a million public sector workers are in the midst of a

that Dublin City Center is now calm and officers are continuing to patrol there is no Terror related activity are related to any wider aspects in relation to this matter it would appear to be a standalone attack and we need to determine the reasons behind that police say a man in his 50s is a person of interest and they're not looking for anyone else the World Health Organization has asked China for information about a mysterious respiratory illness that's affecting children in parts of northern China the agency requested more information about the nature of the infections as China braces for its first full winter season since lifting covid-19 restrictions last December as Katherine Ward explains Canadian experts say the move is prudent and not cause for alarm reports from China's national Health commission about an increased number of respiratory diseases predominantly in children Drew concern from the World Health Organization this month and it happened fast on November 13th the initial increase in respiratory illness was reported at a press conference in China Chinese authorities attributed it to an uptick in viruses including influenza RSV and covid-19 eight days later media began reporting undiagnosed pneumonia in children in some regions of northern China and it was unclear if this was a separate event or part of the overall increase in respiratory infections the next day the who made its request for additional epidemiologic and clinical information not an unusual request according to Canadian experts it's very reasonable as they would in the other place where there's a cluster of um you know infections that appear to be transmissible among a larger group of people in a teleconference Thursday with the wh Chinese officials said they did not detect any unusual or novel diseases in the country experts say post pandemic transparency is Paramount it is absolutely essential that trust that many people have lost in governments in government response and also in in science unfortunately during co uh that this is regained the world is rather sensitized to this as we should be and you know in the case where there is a new pathogen or an emerging pathogen that poses a a global Health threat we need to know as soon as possible so that we can act as quickly as possible probably won't be the case here part of the concern when events like this happen is that viruses capable of triggering pandemics typically start with undiagnosed clusters of respiratory illness however experts stress it's important not to spec ulate and the best course of action is to manage situations like these by facts alone Katherine Ward Global News Toronto an exploding population of so-called super pigs on the Canadian prairies is now concerning American officials the wild pigs have caused havoc in Alberta Saskatchewan and Mano Manitoba since 2001 when the market for wild boore collapsed and some Farmers set the animals free they are not native to North America they threaten native species and cause billions ions of dollars in damage to crops States like Minnesota North Dakota and Montana now say they are taking steps to stop what they fear could be an invasion of the pigs the pressure to buy in ahead an indigenous group lays out its concerns over the federal government's 35 billion doll pipeline expansion Trans Mountain the company building the long delayed pipeline expansion from Alberta to BC says the project is now 95% complete the cost of it has ballooned to $35 billion and the federal government still wants to sell it it's been working to sell stakes in it to dozens of indigenous groups many of them have signed on but the benefits of buying in are being questioned by others along the Route Nara reports we have many leaders that fought for our rights Judy Wilson is from a First Nation along the Transmountain pipeline route which she says did not sign an impact benefit agreement with the company our elders uh and past leaders always cautioned us about these agreements because Canada as a country has broken every promise to our first nation's people Wilson who was chief of that BC interior First Nation for 16 years says a project like Trans Mountain puts at risk not only natural resources but also an entire way of life we get everything we need from the land because we take care of the land the land will take care of you it's not just about these small agreements that they're signing it's about our people collectively not just our generation but the ancestors and the generations to come that's what this is about Trans Mountain says it has signed 69 Mutual benefit agreements with 81 indigenous groups this is a very very valuable piece of real estate a corridor to the global markets the federal government's effort to sell the pipeline are underway it involves talks with more than 120 indigenous communities along the Route stepen Mason heads up the group working with indigenous Nations to buy a stake create a generational wealth a pension fund for those indigenous communities that own the pipeline but what about the nearly $35 billion Canada has sunk into the project Canada's energy regulator decided it won't be probing the growing cost overruns using construction company contracts or specific invoices from suppliers it's people taking advantage of our communities and that they're under durest to saying oh this is the only answer no it's not the only answer Wilson connects the fight against the pipeline to the impact of colonization indigenous cultural genocide and the ferocity of intergenerational trauma you hear a lot of the Chiefs saying well I'm just managing poverty so that's what I'm saying is we're under duress so I see Trans Mountain equally because the federal government owns them doing the same to our people Trans Mountain hopes to have the pipeline expansion Canada's only such system transporting oil from Alberta to here in BC's West Coast operating in the first quarter of 2024 but engineering difficulties could delay the completion to the end of the year Nara Global News Vancouver tomorrow in part two BC indigenous community's

REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN MICHAEL  MCCAUL FROM TEXAS, FOREIGN  AFFAIRS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN AND  ON THE HOMELAND SECURITY  COMMITTEE. THE PERFECT PERSON TO HAVE AS MY FIRST GUEST. WELCOME IN \"FOCUS.\" FIRST OF ALL, WE HAVE STAYED IN  PLACES AFTER WARS AND WHEN YOU  HEAR PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN  NETANYAHU TALKING ABOUT THE  UNAVOIDABILITY OF GIVING  SECURITY TO THE PEOPLE IN GAZA,  WHAT IS YOUR REACTION? >> WELL, I THINK WHAT THEIR PLAN IS TO NOT OCCUPY IT. THEY'LL LEARN FROM OUR MISTAKES  IN AFGHANISTAN NOT OCCUPY GAZA. AS YOU TALKED ABOUT THEY WANT TO ENCIRCLE GAZA CITY, EVENTUALLY  SUFFOCATE OUT HAMAS OUT OF THE  TUNNELS, AND THEN ELIMINATE THE  THREAT. THEY ARE CURRENTLY BUILDING A  BLOCKADE FROM NORTHERN TO  SOUTHERN GAZA WHICH IS TURNING  INTO A HUMANITARIAN ZONE AND NOW WE'RE SEEING ABOUT 100 TRUCKS  PER DAY GO THROUGH THE RAFAH  GATE FROM EGYPT TO ISRAEL RIGHT  NOW. BUT A PAUSE IS -- I THINK I  WOULD SAY LET'S GIVE THEM A  PAUSE ONCE THEY RELEASE THE  HOSTAGES. A CANDLELIGHT VIGIL ON THE  CAPITOL STEPS. WE MET WITH THE FAMILIES WHOSE  CHILDREN ARE IN THESE AWFUL  PLACES IN THE TUNNELS. THAT WOULD BE A GOOD START. GET SOMETHING OUT OF A PAUSE NOT GIVE THEM A PAUSE FOR NOTHING. >> Harris: THESE WORDS ARE SO  CHILLING COMING FROM THE BROTHER OF A MAN TAKEN HOSTAGE BY HAMAS  TERRORISTS. LISTEN TO THIS. THEY ARE A WARNING TO ALL OF US. >> THIS IS A WAKE-UP CALL NOT  ONLY FOR ISRAEL, NOT ONLY FOR  THE JEWISH COMMUNITY, THIS IS A  WAKE-UP CALL FOR WILL OF YOU  HERE, ALL OF AMERICA, ALL OF  EUROPE. YOU ARE NEXT. >> Harris: YOUR REACTION. >> WE'VE SEEN THREATS FROM  OVERSEAS HIT US HERE AT HOME. 9/11 IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT. WHEN I CHAIRED HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE HOW MANY SPECIAL  INTEREST ALIENS GOT IN. HOW MANY ON THE TERROR WATCH  LIST GOT IN. INSPIRED ATTACKS OVER THE  INTERNET WHICH IS WHAT DIRECTOR  WRAY TALKED ABOUT COMING FROM  HAMAS, HIS BIGGEST CONCERN. HARRIS, HOW MANY OF THE 200 ON  THE TERROR WATCH LIST ARE FROM  THE MIDDLE EAST OR ARE HAMAS? WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION. THAT IS VERY DANGEROUS AS A  NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERT. >> Harris: DID YOU SEE SENATORS  ASK MAYOKAS, THE HOMELAND  SECURITY SECRETARY, WHERE THE  169 ARE OR ANY OF THOSE THAT  HAVE COME ACROSS THE BORDER  SINCE THAT NUMBER WAS GIVEN TO  US A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO? PEOPLE ON THE TERROR WATCH LIST? HE COULDN'T ANSWER THAT  QUESTION. >> HE COULDN'T ANSWER THAT  QUESTION. HOW COULD YOU BE SECRETARY IN  CHARGE OF DEFENDING THE HOMELAND AND NOT KNOW WHERE 200 SUSPECTED TERRORISTS ARE IN OUR COUNTRY. IT IS MIND BLOWS HAND SHOWS YOU  HOW DANGEROUS THE FOREIGN POLICY BUT THE BORDER POLICY AS WELL. ALL THIS TIES TOGETHER. THE THREATS FROM OVERSEAS AND  THEN THAT LAST LINE OF DEFENSE  ON THE BORDER WHICH IS WHY WE  NEED TO HAVE BORDER SECURITY  ALONG WITH THE OTHER THREATS  THAT WE SEE COMING FROM RUSSIA,  CHINA, IRAN, NORTH KOREA. >> Harris: IT DISQUALIFIES HIM  AND SURPRISED HE IS SITTING IN  THAT. HE MAKES THE PRESIDENT LOOKS  WORSE BY SITTING THERE AND BIDEN HAS A BAD ENOUGH REPUTATION WITH AN OPEN BORDER. HE DOESN'T NEED HELP NOT KNOWING WHERE THE 169 AND NOW 200 AS YOU JUST POINTED OUT. WE HAVE HAD MORE PEOPLE COME  OVER WHO ARE ON THE TERROR WATCH LIST. ALL RIGHT, LET'S --  >> HE KNOWS BETTER. I KNOW HIM. HE IS A U.S. ATTORNEY. >> Harris: HE KNOWS BETTER. >> HE KNOWS BETTER. THAT'S WHAT'S SO AWFUL ABOUT IT. >> Harris: HE LOST TRACK OF  85,000 MIGRANT CHILDREN IN THE  LAST YEAR AND A HALF. DISQUALIFICATION FOR THE JOB FOR THE POST. ALL RIGHT. HERE IS AN EDITORIAL BOARD  ASKING WHY ISN'T BIDEN DEMANDING HAMAS RELEASE AMERICAN HOSTAGES? FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR JOHN BOLTON IS WARNING ISRAEL IS RUNNING OUT OF TIME BEFORE BIDEN DAMNS IT TO DEFEAT. BLINKEN'S TRIP DEMONSTRATES THE  DANGEROUS MISCONCEPTIONS  UNDERLYING THE MIDDLE EAST  POLICY AND SHOWS HOW RAPIDLY  BIDEN'S SUPERFICIALLY STRONG  SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL IS ERODING. THE IDF ARE RACING AGAINST TIME  BEFORE BIDEN WILTS UNDER  DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL  PRESSURE AND ENEMIES --  >> JOHN BOLTON AND I OFTEN  AGREE. I AGREE WITH HIM IN THIS CASE AS WELL. INSTEAD OF HELPING ISRAEL  ELIMINATE THE THREAT, THEY ARE  CALLING FOR A HUMANITARIAN  PAUSE. CAN YOU IMAGINE AFTER PEARL  HARBOR OR SAY 9/11 WE HAD  ANOTHER COUNTRY TELLING US WE  HAD TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF A  PAUSE BEFORE WE TOOK OUT THE  ENEMY? I THINK LOOK, WE'LL TAKE A PAUSE IF THEY'LL RELEASE THE HOSTAGES. JOHN BOLTON IS RIGHT. PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  HAS NEVER CALLED FOR THEIR  RELEASE. YOU KNOW, THE MEMBERS OF  CONGRESS DID BIPARTISAN JUST  YESTERDAY IN PASSING A  UNANIMOUSLY PASSING A RESOLUTION AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE  CAPITOL STEPS TALKING ABOUT THAT WITH THE FAMILIES AND CANDLES IN HAND. THEY NEED TO COME HOME OR WE'LL  ELIMINATE HAMAS. THAT'S THE CHOICE RIGHT THERE. >> Harris: SO YOU SAY WE WILL  ELIMINATE HAMAS. WOULD WE COMMIT TO HELPING  ISRAEL DO THAT EVEN MORE THAN WE ALREADY HAVE WITH MUNITIONS AND  MONEY AT THIS POINT? >> NO. >> Harris: I THOUGHT IT WAS NOT  A HAIR ON AN AMERICAN'S HEAD. NOW MORE THAN 30 DEAD THAT WE  KNOW OF AT THE HANDS OF HAMAS  BUT ALSO OUR MILITARY BASES ARE  GETTING HIT. THE NUMBER OF MEN AND WOMEN IN  PERIL HAS GONE UP TO 40 ATTACKS  AGAINST MILITARY BASES. MEN AND WOMEN IN THE MILITARY IN THE REGION. AMERICAN CONTRACTOR ALSO KILLED  IN THOSE ATTACKS. >> CORRECT. THIS IS ALL COMING FROM IRAN. THEIR FINGERPRINTS ARE ALL OVER  IT. THE PROXIES OF IRAN, HAMAS,  HEZBOLLAH AND IRAN-BACKED  MILITIAS IN IRAQ AND SYRIA. YOU HAVE THE CARRIER STRIKE  FORCES IN THE MEDITERRANEAN,  PERSIAN GULF AND NUCLEAR  SUBMARINE. THEY WAITED EIGHT DAYS AFTER THE STRIKES HAD HAPPENED. WHEN I SAY WE, WE HELP THEM TO  RESPOND TO HAMAS. HONESTLY THE ADMINISTRATION  DOESN'T HAVE AUTHORITY FROM  CONGRESS TO GO AFTER HAMAS  DIRECTLY OR HEZBOLLAH WITHOUT AN AUTHORIZATION OF USE OF MILITARY FORCE FROM MY COMMITTEE, THE  FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE ON  CAPITOL HILL. >> Harris: IS THAT COMING? >> WE ARE LOOKING AT IT IN THE  EVENT IT'S NECESSARY. GOD, LET'S HOPE WE'LL NEVER HAVE TO PASS THAT. >> Harris: YEAH. IT COULD JUST BE RETALIATION FOR HURTING OUR MILITARY MEN AND  WOMEN.

AND NEWS THAT THERE IS A NEW  WEAPON THAT THEY ARE DEPLOYING. M MADE GELLEN COMMANDO UNIT. AND I WANT TO GET TO NIC  ROBERTSON. THIS IS NEW INFORMATION IN ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY ISRAEL IS DOING. WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED ABOUT THIS WEAPON AND THIS UNIT THAT WE  UNDERSTAND CALLED THE MAGELLAN  COMMANDO UNIT? >> Reporter: YES, A SPECIALIST  UNIT USING A SPECIAL NEW WEAPON. THIS IS A WEAPON THAT ADVANCES  TECHNOLOGICALLY THE OLD  FASHIONED MORE TAB. OLD FASHIONED IS SORT OF A CLOSE INFANTRY TOOL THAT YOU USE IT  CLOSE TO THE FRONTLINE OR A  LITTLE FURTHER BACK, IT FIRES  REALLY HIGH IN THE AIR, GOES  RIGHT UP AND COMES RIGHT DOWN. TYPICALLY IN THE PAST YOU NEED A FORWARD SPOTTER WHO CAN SEE  WHERE IT IS HITTING AND IT TAKES MAYBE THREE ROUNDS FOR A GOOD  MORTAR TEAM TO PUT A ROUND  PRECISELY ON THE TARGET. THIS NEW SYSTEM APPARENTLY DOES  AWAY WITH THAT, IT IS COMPUTER  CONTROLLED, YOU DIAL IN THE  DESIGNATED LOCATION OF THE  TARGET A THIS MORTAR FIRES AND HITS THAT TARGET WITH PINPOINT  ACCURATE. THAT IS WHAT THE IDF IS SAYING. SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN? IT MEANS WHEN THEY SEE A SMALL  JIHAD OR HAMAS UNIT OUT IN THE  FIELD WITH ANTI-TANK UNIT, THEY  CAN PINPOINT THEM PRECISELY AND  HIT THEM QUICKLY AND READILY. WE WEREN'T AWARE OF THIS BEING  OPERATIONAL IN THE REGION, WE'RE USED TO HEARING THE I EXPLOSION  AND ARTILLERY, BUT THIS HAD A  WHOLE NEW SOUND. AND WHEN WE HEARD THIS ONE, WE  WENT FOR COVER BECAUSE IT MADE A HUGE WHOOSH AND WE DIDN'T KNOW  WHAT IT WAS. SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE  IDF REALLY HOPES CAN HELP IT  TARGET PRECISELY SMALL GROUPS. >> AND IT IS INTERESTING THAT  YOU ARE SAYING THAT YOU CAN BY  AUDIO HEAR THAT IT IS VERY  DIFFERENT, THAT YOUR PHYSICAL  REACTION IS DIFFERENT. VERY SIGNIFICANT. AND OF COURSE IN UKRAINE YOU  HEAR ARTILLERY AND ARE USED TO  ALL OF THE SOUNDS. JUST SOME CONTEXT HERE THOUGH. 320 STRIKES OVERNIGHT. THEY SAID 205 I THINK THE DAY  BEFORE YESTERDAY. SO I'M JUST PUTTING IT OUT HERE  TO MAKE A POINT THAT IS MORE  THAN 500 STRIKES IN ANY GIVEN 48 HOUR PERIOD. AND EVEN THE PALESTINIAN HEALTH  AUTHORITY IS NOT SAYING THAT  THERE IS ANYWHERE NEAR THAT  NUMBER OF DEATHS A DAY. SO I'M MAKING THIS POINT TO MAKE USE OF THE WORLD PRECISION. THAT THEY ARE INCREDIBLY PRECISE AND IT SEEMS LIKE IN SOME CASES  THEY ARE ACTUALLY TARGETED AT  OPERATION COMMAND CENTERS NOT  NECESSARILY INDIVIDUAL HAMAS  OPERATIVES, RIGHT? >> ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU, ERIN. WITH US NOW, EDITOR AND FOREIGN  AFFAIRS COLUMNIST AT BLOOMBERG  BOBBY GOSHE AND ALSO CO-AUTHOR  OF A NEW BOOK COMING OUT, GENIUS OF ISRAEL. THAT YOU THINK BOTH FOR BEING  HERE. -- THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING  HERE. I WANT TO BEGIN WITH WHAT WE  HEARD FROM THE KING OF JORDAN. DAN, THIS IS A U.S. ALLY, BUT HE WAS EMPHATIC CHOOSING HIS WORDS  CAREFULLY AND SENDING A MESSAGE. HERE HE WAS. >> THE RELENTLESS BOMBING  CAMPAIGN UNDER WAY AS WE SPEAK  IS CRUEL AND UNCONSCIONABLE ON  EVERY LEVEL. IT IS COLLECTIVE PUNISHMENT OF A BESIEGED AND HELPLESS PEOPLE. IT IS A FLAGRANT VIOLATIONS OF  INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW. IT IS A WAR CRIME. >> YOU HEAR THAT COUPLED WITH  OUR REPORTING THAT THE U.S. IS  URGING ISRAEL TO PAUSE, TO WAIT, TO TRY TO ALLOW MORE TIME TO GET HOSTAGES OUT. AND THE IDF SAYS THERE IS NO  CEASEFIRE, THERE IS NO PAUSE. WHAT IS YOUR READ? >> TWO THINGS GOING ON. WHEN YOU HEAR LEADERS IN THE  REGION MAKING THOSE STATEMENTS,  I THINK THEY ARE CONCERNED  PARTICULARLY KING OF JORDAN WHO  IS WORRIED ABOUT REAL VOLATILITY IN HIS OWN POPULATION IN JORDAN  AND WHETHER OR NOT THE TENSIONS  BETWEEN ISRAEL AND XWGAZA, ISRA  AND HAMAS, COULD HAVE CASCADING  EFFECTS FOR HIS OWN SECURITY AND HIS OWN ARAB WORLD  ARE QUITELY SAYING I HOPE ISRAEL WIPES OUT HAMAS ONCE AND FOR  ALL. SO WHAT THEY SAY PRIVATELY AND  PUBLICLY ARE TWO DIFFERENT  THINGS. >> THE QUESTION IS THE COST. HIS WIFE WHO IS PALESTINIAN  REALLY CONCERNED AS WELL ABOUT  THE TREATMENT OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. >> I THINK THERE ARE LEGITIMATE  CONCERNS ABOUT THE PALESTINIAN  CIVILIANS. THE QUESTION IS WHO IS  RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT, WHO CAN  ULTIMATELY CONTROL THEIR FATE. IS IT ISRAEL OR HAMAS. THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION'S AGENDA IS DIFFERENT. I BELIEVE THAT THE BIDEN  ADMINISTRATION HAS MINOR MILD  HOPE THAT THEY WILL GET OUT SOME OF THE HOSTAGES PARTICULARLY  HOSTAGES WITH AMERICAN  PASSPORTS. WE SAW TWO RELEASED LAST WEEK. I THINK HAMAS IS PLAYING A VERY  CLEVER GAME WHERE THEY ARE  STARTING TO DRIBBLE OUT  HOSTAGES. I THINK YOU WILL SEE MORE OF  THAT. SO THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS  SAYING IF WE'RE GOING TO GET OUT A COUPLE HOUSE DAMAGES HERE AND  THERE, THERE IS A FAMILY I'M  MEETING WITH HERE TODAY WHO HAS  A SON AS A HOSTAGE. SO A LOT OF THE PARENTS ARE  ORGANIZED AS WELL THEY SHOULD BE AND THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS  SAYING GIVE IT TIME. THIS PUTS ISRAEL IN A REAL  CONUNDRUM BECAUSE THEY CAN WAIT  AND THEY CAN WAIT AND THEY CAN  WAIT A. AT SOME POINT THE CONCERN THAT  WILL UNDERMINE THEIR OWN FUTURE  OPERATION AND IF ALL THAT IS  RELEASED AT THE END OF IT ARE  HOSTAGES EXCEPT FOR THOSE THAT  ARE JUST ISRAELI PASSPORTS. >> DAN GETS AT THE COMPLEXITY  HERE WHICH I'VE SPENT A LOT OF  TIME TRYING TO GET MY HEAD  AROUND IT. WHILE I'M CERTAINLY NOT A  FOREIGN POLICY EXPERT, I'VE  COVERED THIS STUFF LONG ENOUGH  TO KNOW THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT  GIVEN HOW MANY CROSS CUTTING  VARIABLES. YOU TALK ABOUT LEADERS IN THE  REGION WHO SAY SOMETHING  PUBLICLY FOR EFFECT AND SAYING  U.S. WANTS HOSTAGES OUT BUT ALSO MOVING IN SIGNIFICANT FORCE  POSTURE INCREASES FOR DETERRENCE PURPOSES, ALSO POTENTIALLY  GETTING DRAWN INTO SOMETHING  BIGGER. WHILE ALSO TRYING TO HUG ISRAEL  AND ITS LEADERS WHO THEY KNOW  WILL EVENTUALLY LAUNCH A GROUND  INCURSION. HOW DOES THIS ALL MOVE FORWARD  IN THE WEEKS AHEAD GIVEN WHAT  DAN IS TALKING ABOUT, THE  HOSTAGES WHERE ISRAELIS ARE,  GROUND INCURSION, ALL THESE  ELEMENTS? >> IT WILL MOVE FORWARD VERY,  VERY SLOWLY UNTIL THE GROUND  OFFENSIVE TAKES PLACE AND THEN  IT MOVES VERY QUICKLY. SO THAT IS THE NATURE OF THESE  THINGS. THINGS HAPPEN SLOWLY UNTIL THEY  SUDDENLY HAPPEN VERY, VERY  QUICKLY. THE TRIGGERING EVENT NOW WILL BE THE GROUND INVASION. UNTIL THEN, THERE WILL BE ALL  THE DIPLOMACY GOING AROUND IT,  THERE WILL BE MORE DEPENDING ON  HOW LONG THE SORT OF --  DEPENDINGING ON HOW MUCH TIME  ISRAEL TAKES TO LAUNCH THE  GROUND OFFENSIVE. I IMAGINE THERE WILL BE MORE  GATHERINGS OF REGIONAL LEADERS. S SECRETARY BLINKEN WILL BE ON THE ROAD ALL THE TIME TO TRY TO HERD ALL THE CATS TOGETHER. THERE WILL BE A LOT OF  NEGOTIATIONS BEHIND THE SCENES  FOR THOSE HOSTAGES AND THERE  WILL BE A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS  BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE AND  NETANYAHU. >> WHEN YOU SAY TRIGGERING, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? WHAT DOES IT TRIGGER? THAT IS OBVIOUSLY THE BIG  CONCERN WHEN YOU TALK TO U.S.  OFFICIALS.  >> CALCULATION AS TO WHEN THE  GROUND OFFENSIVE BEGINS WILL BE  MADE BY THE ISRAELIS AND THEY  WILL CONSIDER ALL KINDS OF  FACTORS INCLUDING THE PRESSURE  FROM THE UNITED STATES. BUT AS DAN POINTED OUT, THEY  NEED TO MOVE IN BEFORE TOO LONG. THERE IS A TIME LIMIT ON HOW  MUCH THEY CAN WAIT. THERE IS MOMENTUM. WE KEEP THINKING OF THE PRESSURE THAT IS BEING PUT ON NETANYAHU  FROM THE OUTSIDE. WE'RE NOT PAYING ENOUGH  ATTENTION TO THE PRESSURE FROM  WITHIN, FROM ISRAELIS. AND YOUR CORRESPONDENTS ON THE  GROUND WILL KNOW THIS BETTER --  ERIN AND NIC, THAT ISRAELIS WANT TO SEE SOMETHING DONE. WE'RE NOW TWO WEEKS AWAY FROM  THE HORRIFIC EVENTS THAT BEGAN  THIS CHAIN OF OFFENSES. AND THOSE EVENTS ARE STILL FRESH IN THE MINDS OF ISRAELIS. THEY STILL WANT A RECKONING FOR  WHAT HAPPENED ON THE 7th OF  OCTOBER. THEY STILL WANT TO MAKE SURE  THAT THAT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. THERE IS A LOT OF PRESSURE ON  NETANYAHU TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON  HIS PROMISES, TO GO IN AND  FINISH HAMAS ONCE AND FOR ALL. WE CAN DISCUSS AROUND THIS TABLE WHETHER THAT IS EVEN POSSIBLE,  BUT WE MUST NOT DISCOUNT THE  STRENGTH OF FEELING IN ISRAEL  AND THE IMPACT THAT FEELING HAS  ON NETANYAHU'S DISPOSITION  TOWARDS GAZA. >> THE POINT EARLIER ABOUT WHAT  LEADERS SAY IN PUBLIC AND WHAT  THEY SAY BEHIND CLOSED DOOR,  II  THINK IT IS INTERESTING THAT CNN IS REPORTING THAT THE U.S.  ADMINISTRATION WANTS THEM TO  DELAY THAT INVASION. BUT NOT SOMETHING THAT WE'VE  HEARD PUBLICLY FROM THE  PRESIDENT EXCEPT FOR WHAT HIS  TEAM SAYS WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING OF HIM SAYING YES TO A QUESTION  OVER THE WEEKEND. DO YOU THINK THERE COMES A POINT WHEN THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE  PRESIDENT SAYS OUT LOUD? >> NO. I THINK THE PRESIDENT'S APPROACH SO FAR HAS BEEN TO GIVE THE  ISRAELI GOVERNMENT AND THE  ISRAELI PEOPLE A BIG BEAR HUG IN PUBLIC, SAY I HAVE YOUR BACK. WHAT HE DID WAS DRAMATIC BY  SHOWING UP AND MEETING WITH THE  CAR CABINETS. BUT FORWARD LEANING AND SORT OF  ATTACHED AT THE HIP MESSAGE  PUBLICLY. AND PRIVATELY CONVEYING HIS  MESSAGES. I DO NOT BELIEVE --  >> EVER? >> I CAN'T SAY EVER. BUT NEAR TERM I DON'T THINK THAT HE WILL PRESSURIZE REALLY  BECAUSE THE DETERRENT EFFECT TH  THAT WOULD WIPE OUT AND THE  MESSAGE IT WOULD SEND TO  HEZBOLLAH AND IRAN WOULD BE  HEZBOLLAH AND IRAN WOULD BE  DISASTROUS. >> THANKS, GUYS.

upset and crying they tell us seeing this rally happening here today and seeing the amount of people and support that it had makes them feel unsafe here [Music] shame I feel scared for my life I'm a Jewish student on [Music] campus clashes on the udub campus with multiple heated emotional confrontations among supporters for Israel and those rallying for Palestine this is bringing me to tears my whole family lives in Israel 50 people I know I have friends there I know soldiers there the death toll in the conflict now rising to well over a thousand including one of the University's own PhD grad Dr hyim katsman almost every student has a first or second degree connection to someone who is either murdered missing taken hostage or or is fighting on the front lines there's no mistake if you're standing with the Palestinian people right now you're not standing with the people you're standing with Hamas the rally is part of a so-called national day of resistance involving student groups who say they support the liberation of Palestine but others called the rally misguided this isn't about Freedom this isn't about land rights this isn't about occupation like this is about right and wrong I think that there's a lot of blind support for Palestine right now and people are accidentally supporting what is pretty much worldwide known as a terrorist organization many heated confrontations had to be broken up but one ultimately ended the rally after a group followed another into a nearby building campus police also responded but despite the issues so far there have been no reports of any serious injuries I am surprised at the amount of support for Palestine I support the Palestinian civilians um the civilians have done no wrong they deserve equal rights they deserve to be free in their own country um but what I don't support is Hamas and some students here telling me that they're extremely disappointed also in the university presid university president's handling of all of this telling me tonight that they are heartbroken that there hasn't been a stronger message condemning the terrorist attacks reporting live in Seattle lenan win Como news lenan thank you and during her annual addressed this morning University of Washington President Anna Marie cow said the school does not condone today's rally I mean we can have debates about um you know the situation in Palestine for the last 75 years but there is no question that these Hamas attacks on civilians were absolutely reprehensible if you've watched on TV the nature of these attacks they absolutely make your blood curl and no one should be celebrating these atrocities and I want to be clear that I condemn any messages and posts that celebrate violence against civilians C did say the rally was allowed to go on because the organizer statements quote fall under the definition of protected speech law enforcement agencies including here in Seattle were already on heightened alert even before hamas's call for a global protest today Kos mider has more on what agencies are doing to keep communities safe police departments Across the Nation on heightened state of alert as a deadly Israel Gaza conflict continues law enforcement agencies closely monitoring for any potential violent or disruptive demonstrations a spokesperson for the Seattle Police Department sent a statement to KO news that reads the Seattle Police Department is aware that events will be occurring in the city of Seattle and throughout the United States SPD will allocate resources if necessary to continue to keep the residents of Seattle safe earlier this week SPD and Mayor Bruce Harold called for peace in the City and surrounding places of worship here in Seattle a heightened police presence was seen at a vigil for Israel what we're really going to do is is ask um the Jewish community of Seattle and our allies Beyond and there considerable allies who have reached out to us to um to stand with us not only in this most intensive moment but also in the weeks ahead the FBI also telling KO news they are working closely with Washington law enforcement to share information and identify and disrupt any threats that may emerge everyone should pray for the Peace of Israel the Peace of the Middle East and the Peace of for the world in Seattle midder KO news that brings us to this morning's KO pulse poll we're asking will you be changing weekend plans because of potential security threats or protests right now 22% of people say yes I'm concerned most people at 44% say no you've got to live your life another 34% say not yet but watching closely if you'd like to add your vote just point your phone's camera at the QR code there on the side of the screen that creates a link that will take you directly to the

and be ready if needed as an allout War continues to wreck havoc in the Middle East US cities feeling the aftermath as protests and rallies on either side pop up Across the Nation happening at the University of Washington students are actually frightened heated and emotional clashes among supporters for Israel and those rallying for Palestine there are so many innocent lives that are going to be lost as a result of this earlier this week the Seattle Police Department and Mayor Bruce Harold calling for peace in the City and surrounding places of worship I think um security has been something that every Jewish organization has had to contend with a heightened police presence seen surrounding a vigil for Israel in Seattle attendees say despite the threat they stand with their brothers and sisters from across the world when it comes to survival and support for Israel we do not waver one bit the FBI been telling KO news they are working closely with Washington law enforcement to share information and identify and disrupt any threats that may emerge to stand with us not only in this most intensive moment but also in the weeks ahead when oftentimes if history is
